My fellow Tongans and Pacific Islanders, I have an exciting opportunity to share with you all. On Wednesday, May 15th from 5-7pm, the [Tonga Women in ICT (TWICT)](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100083222176057) group will be hosting an insightful session on the cutting-edge field of Generative AI and Prompt Engineering.

For those unfamiliar, Prompt Engineering refers to the art of crafting effective prompts or instructions to interact with powerful language models and AI systems. Being skilled at prompt engineering doesn't require coding expertise - creativity and persistence are key.

The learning objectives for this session include:

- Describing basic prompting techniques
- Applying best practices to create effective prompts for generative AI

We'll dive into types like zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting with examples, and chain-of-thought prompting to encourage AI systems to explain their reasoning. You'll learn strategies for iterating and refining prompts when you get stuck.

Why is this so relevant for our Pacific communities? Generative AI represents an incredible opportunity to uplift our voices and empower our narratives through technology. By mastering prompting skills, we can more effectively guide AI language models to assist with tasks like:

- Generating ideas and content tailored to our cultural contexts
- Analyzing and summarizing complex information through a Pacific lens
- Exploring creative applications that fuse ancient wisdom with cutting-edge innovation  

So I hereby encourage all my fellow Tongans and Pacific Islanders - technologists, policymakers, students, and curious minds alike - to register for this free TWICT event using the link provided. Let's come together, learn, discuss and begin shaping the AI tools and systems that can elevate our islands into a new era of technological self-determination.

Just as our ancestors were pioneers in wayfinding and navigation, we too can chart new paths as pioneers of ethical, equitable AI development and deployment for the collective wellbeing of our region.  

The revolution will be AI-powered, and it will be Pasifika-led. 

Come join us!
