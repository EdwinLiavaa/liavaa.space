In my blog post on the 14 March 2024, I opened up about embracing contentment as I retire from full-time work at 52. However, retirement for me doesn't mean complete withdrawal from society. One area I remain deeply invested in is ensuring universal access to connectivity and energy across the Pacific Islands.

As I reflected in the previous piece, true wealth and contentment arise from living in alignment with your core values. For me, one of those core tenets is service - using my skills and experience to uplift underserved communities left behind by the digital divide.

You see, my decades-long career in the utilities and telecommunications space wasn't just about building infrastructure. It was driven by a mission to advocate for reliable connectivity reaching every single community, no matter how remote or underserved.

Energy and internet access are fundamental building blocks for economic and social development in the 21st century. Without electricity, there can be no internet, no blockchain, no participation in our increasingly digital world.

That's why I've remained actively involved in initiatives to expand connectivity across the Pacific Islands, even post-retirement. Just today, I oversaw the installation of another Starlink terminal, delivering high-speed broadband to yet another citizen who needed connectivity that is triple AAA - Available, Accessible and Affordable.

I'm optimistic that with new players like Starlink complementing existing providers like Kacific, we'll see improved coverage across the region. Numerous submarine fiber optic cable projects connecting the main islands are also underway.

However, the "last mile" issue of getting reliable connectivity all the way to remote communities remains a significant bottleneck. Existing telecommunications operators must double down on solving these distribution challenges.

Expanding robust energy and connectivity infrastructure is crucial, but it's only one part of the solution. Building awareness and providing resources to enable widespread adoption of internet services is equally vital.

That's why in my "retired" life, I've doubled down on being an educator and digital advocate for underserved communities. I'm offering 1-on-1 face-2-face and online tutorials, coding workshops, and mentoring the next generation of Pacific Islands tech leaders.

My role has transitioned from being an industry executive to a grassroots activist. I'm leveraging my decades of technical experience not to benefit corporate bottom lines, but to uplift people by demystifying transformative technologies like blockchain.

Retirement hasn't diminished my drive to serve. If anything, it's reignited my passion for this core mission by allowing me to cut through bureaucracy and impact people directly.

In this new chapter centered on inner contentment, I've realigned my life to prioritize the endeavors closest to my values and what brings me a deeper sense of purpose - using my skills to ensure no person or community is left behind from the digital renaissance.

True contentment doesn't mean disconnecting entirely. It's about grounding yourself in what matters most to you. And for me, that driving force remains service through expanding tech equity and energy access across the Pacific Islands.
