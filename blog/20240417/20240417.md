As a long-time advocate for free and open-source software (FOSS), I've always championed the core principles of digital freedom, transparency, and self-determination. In my previous blog post, I shared how I have been building capacity in empowering Pacific Island communities by transitioning them to Linux and other open-source computing solutions.

However, as I continued reflecting on my role as a FOSS proponent, I realized that I needed to take my own advice and practice what I preach. That's why I've now made the decision to completely unplug my personal website, https://liavaa.space, from the traditional web hosting matrix and migrate all of my content to the open, decentralized platform of GitHub.

For far too long, I've relied on proprietary, centralized platforms to host my online presence, inadvertently perpetuating the very dependency on corporate technology that I've been working to dismantle in my local communities. But no more. It's time to walk the walk and demonstrate true digital self-sovereignty.

By hosting my personal content on GitHub, I'm not only liberating myself from the constraints of traditional web hosting, but I'm also aligning my digital footprint with the values of the FOSS movement. GitHub, as an open-source code repository and collaboration platform, embodies the ethos of transparency, community, and user empowerment that I've long championed.

Moreover, this transition allows me to take full control over the content and infrastructure of my online presence. No longer will I be beholden to the terms, policies, and potential censorship of third-party platforms. Instead, I'll be the sole steward of my digital domain, with the ability to freely customize, update, and secure my website as I see fit.

This move also opens up exciting new possibilities for collaboration and community-driven development. By hosting my content on GitHub, I can invite others to contribute, suggest improvements, or even fork my content and build upon it - further amplifying the collaborative spirit that lies at the heart of the FOSS movement.

As I embark on this new chapter of digital self-reliance, I'm reminded of the powerful words of [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman), the founder of the Free Software Foundation: "Free software is a matter of liberty, not price." It's a sentiment that has guided my journey as a FOSS advocate, and one that I'm now fully embracing by unplugging from the matrix and embracing the liberating power of open-source hosting.

So, if you've been following my work and advocacy around Linux, PasifikaOS, Web3, Blockchain, AI/ML, GIS/Geomatics, digital transformation and empowerment in the Pacific, I invite you to join me on this next step of the journey. Head over to my GitHub [repository](https://github.com/EdwinLiavaa) and [liavaa.space](https://github.com/EdwinLiavaa/liavaa.space) to explore the latest content, resources, and opportunities to collaborate. Together, let's continue building a more transparent, equitable, and community-driven digital future - one that honors the principles of freedom and self-determination that have long defined the FOSS ethos.
