Within a time frame of 1 week, I managed to setup 2 Starlink wide area networks for 2 of my friends. Today I migrated 2 of one of my friend's computers to Linux, more tomorrow ðŸ˜Š. It feels great getting my hands dirty and doing the work I am passionate about. 

My journey from being a corporate executive to retirement as a 1-man-band freelance engineer is the best decision I have ever made during my 30+ years career in the Tech Industry. If I can make a difference in 1 or 2 peoples lives with what I have accumulated throughout my decades of experience in the Industry, I am more than happy that I have done justice to my calling. 

As an advocate for the free as in freedom and open-source software (FOSS) movement, my mission to empower underserved communities has only intensified in my retirement. With more time and resources at my disposal, I've been able to directly address one of the greatest challenges facing the Pacific Islands region - the reliance on cracked proprietary software that leaves users vulnerable to security threats.

In one of my earlier blog posts, I discussed my overarching goal of building capacity and self-reliance among the students and communities I mentor. This philosophy extends from my work with the PasifikaOS project - a community-driven Linux distribution I spearheaded to meet the unique needs of Pacific Islanders.

PasifikaOS was based on the lightweight and energy-efficient Lubuntu variant of Ubuntu, tailored to provide an elegant, user-friendly computing experience. But more importantly, it empowers users with the freedom and security of an open-source operating system, free from the constraints and risks of pirated proprietary software.

However, despite my best efforts from May 2019 to April 2020, the PasifikaOS project failed to gain significant traction and adoption across the islands. I realized that while the intentions were noble, the execution fell short of truly empowering local communities with the right tools and resources.

Undeterred, I've since rededicated my retirement to a new mission - championing the Linux Mint distribution as the open-source computing solution the Pacific so desperately needs.

You see, the recurring costs of software subscriptions have forced many in the Pacific to resort to illegally downloaded versions of Windows and other closed-source programs. Not only does this leave them exposed to malware and viruses, but it also perpetuates a cycle of dependence on corporate goodwill and licensing schemes that simply don't align with the values of these island communities.

By championing Linux and other FOSS alternatives, I aim to break that dependency and empower Pacific Islanders with true digital self-sovereignty. Open-source software puts the power back in the hands of users, allowing them to customize, maintain and secure their own computing environments without relying on external entities.

This aligns perfectly with my overarching mission of fostering self-reliance rather than creating dependency. Just as I strive to mentor students to become autonomous learners, building capacity on Linux is about equipping entire communities with the tools and know-how to manage their own technology infrastructure.

In my retirement, I've had the privilege of working directly with grass-roots people to install Linux on their devices, training them on its features and capabilities. The feedback has been tremendously rewarding, with users expressing relief at finally having a secure, cost-effective computing solution tailored to their needs.

One of the greatest joys is seeing the sense of empowerment and ownership that comes with transitioning to an open-source operating system. Rather than feeling like passive consumers of technology, Pacific Islanders are embracing their role as active contributors and stewards of their digital ecosystems.

This is the true power of free and open-source software - it's not just about access to free-of-cost tools, but about the freedom to control your own technological destiny. And in a region as geographically dispersed and culturally unique as the Pacific Islands, that digital self-determination is vital for building resilient, self-reliant communities.

As I continue my advocacy work around Linux and other FOSS initiatives, my mission remains clear: to equip the Pacific with the technological autonomy and security they deserve, free from the constraints of corporate monopolies and proprietary software. It's a journey towards digital empowerment, rooted in the values of freedom, community and self-sufficiency that have long defined our Pasifika nations.
