The Bitcoin Games Hackathon 2024 has come to a close, and the winners have been announced. While I didn't take home the top prize on the Propaganda Track, I'm thrilled to share that I've achieved a new milestone - earning the [Devpost X Hackathons - Level 2 badge!](https://devpost.com/etuini-liavaa/achievements)

This achievement is a testament to my unwavering commitment to innovation and perseverance in the blockchain space. By submitting separate eligible projects to multiple hackathons, I've demonstrated my ability to adapt, learn, and grow. And, I'm proud to say that I'm now a silver-level participant!

But here's the thing: this achievement isn't a reason to slow down or rest on my laurels. If anything, it's fueling my drive to take PasifikaOS to the next level. The Bitcoin Games Hackathon experience has been a valuable learning opportunity, and I'm more determined than ever to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible with decentralized technologies.

In the spirit of Bitcoin's resilience and adaptability, I'll be coming back stronger and more committed than ever. The setbacks and challenges are an integral part of the journey, and I'm ready to face them head-on. My vision for PasifikaOS remains unwavering, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.

My Philosophy is to embrace contentment in celebrating both our wins and losses. It is what defines our roadmap and our legacy in this space. So, bring it on! I'll be back with renewed energy and determination to make a meaningful impact in the blockchain space. The Bitcoin Games Hackathon 2025, here I come!
