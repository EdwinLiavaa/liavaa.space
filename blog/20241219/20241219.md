Quite a number of my fellow citizens are pushing for me to get into politics, especially in the upcoming Tonga Parliamentary Election next year in 2025. Yet, I find myself questioning why I would want to join a system that feels so fundamentally broken. The very political landscape we navigate seems riddled with inefficiencies and a disconnect from the true aspirations of our people. Rather than stepping into a role that perpetuates these issues, I believe it’s more impactful for me to continue what I’m doing now—providing capacity and advocacy for the next generation.

I’ve spent countless hours exploring the ideas in my [whitepaper](https://github.com/EdwinLiavaa/Whitepaper) on a decentralized micro-governance model, and it's clear to me that the existing system often fails to serve its citizens. While I appreciate the intentions behind traditional governance, it’s evident that it can fall short of truly reflecting the voices of the populace. Instead of diving into a flawed system, I want to empower the youth and inspire them to embrace change.

I think of leaders like [Sarah Knafo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Knafo), the European MP who has taken a bold stance by advocating for a strategic Bitcoin reserve, challenging conventional economic systems along the way. Her vision for decentralization and financial freedom is compelling, but it also highlights the need for new approaches rather than clinging to outdated frameworks. I envision myself as a mentor, helping the next generation understand and navigate these complexities, encouraging them to think outside the confines of the current political structure.

My focus is on fostering a new wave of leaders who can step up and enact meaningful change. By providing advocacy and support, I hope to inspire future leaders to leap into the political arena with fresh perspectives and innovative ideas. Rather than joining a broken system, I want to cultivate a grassroots movement that prioritizes the voices of the people and redefines governance in a way that truly serves our communities.

As we approach the elections, my commitment is to engage with young citizens, to listen to their dreams and concerns, and to equip them with the tools they need to advocate for themselves. I firmly believe that the path to a better Tonga lies in nurturing the potential of those who will inherit this country.

But what if I consider a different approach? What if I join them to win them? By stepping into the political arena, I could bring the values and ideas I hold dear into the very heart of governance. This could be an opportunity to influence the system from within, advocating for decentralization, financial freedom, and regulatory clarity. Instead of merely critiquing the existing framework, I could work to reshape it, ensuring that the voices of the people are genuinely represented.

Ultimately, entering politics is not just about holding a position of power; it’s about embodying the values and aspirations of our people. If I take this leap, I will strive to create a governance framework that prioritizes the principles I believe in. Together, we can foster a society where every Tongan feels empowered to shape our collective future. I envision a political landscape where the youth are encouraged to participate, where their ideas and innovations are welcomed, and where governance truly reflects our shared vision.

With courage and determination, let’s embark on this journey toward a more prosperous and self-determined Tonga. Whether I choose to advocate from the outside or step into the fray, my commitment to nurturing the next generation remains steadfast. By empowering our young leaders, we can create a movement that transcends the limitations of the current system, paving the way for a brighter future for all Tongans.
