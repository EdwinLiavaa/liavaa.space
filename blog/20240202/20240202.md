SpaceX's Starlink and laser mesh network highlight the immense potential of space-based communication systems. As the technology evolves, direct laser links from satellites to ground receivers could provide an alternative to undersea fiber optic cables for long-distance data transmission.

Currently, nearly all intercontinental internet traffic flows through a web of submarine cables crisscrossing the oceans. While cables have tens of terabits per second capacity, emerging space laser networks like Starlink promise a new paradigm.

There is still a need to do further study before using laser links between satellites and ground stations. This kind of optical link would require both more angular tracking and probably atmospheric correction for lasers to maintain stable links to ground stations. And by daisy-chaining connections through constellations, the reach could be global. Starlink is already beaming 42 petabytes per day with lasers in testing.

As laser power and efficiency improves, direct atmospheric transmission from space may become viable for ultra-high bandwidth links across continents. No longer constrained by undersea routes, networks could dynamically shift connections.

Combined with planned direct satellite-to-phone service starting in 2024, ubiquitous global roaming seems possible. Islands and remote areas could bypass physical cable connections entirely through space-based infrastructure.

Cables are still in favor for core backbone use, but innovations like SpaceX's Starlink and Amazonâ€™s Project Kuiper points to an intriguing future for space-based optical networks. While still early, advancing laser technology could make submarine cables obsolete for some applications in the coming decades. Beam-based links may bring the world online through a literal web of light.
