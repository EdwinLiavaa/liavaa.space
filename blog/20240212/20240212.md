As a veteran developer with decades of experience coding and building systems, I've had the privilege of working remotely as a digital nomad. While I still love cutting code, I've slowly transitioned into more corporate development and strategy roles rather than being heads-down coding all day.

With age comes wisdom, and I've realized the importance of achieving more work-life balance. I am being intentional about my career, thus pairing my experience with emerging technologies like AI allows me to pseudo-pair program by chatting about requirements, drafting ideas, and iteratively improving output.

It's essential for us developers to stay engaged with the community - attending events, open-sourcing, and mentoring. Groups like the Chainlink Developers Experts, DLT Talents and Cyfrin Updraft keep me connected to blockchain innovations.

But we also need to pass the torch to the next generation of talented young developers who will advance the industry. They keep me on my toes and humble about how much more there is to learn.

The future looks bright, especially with the fusion of wisdom from experienced developers with the latest emerging tech advancements. I'm excited to pair my lifelong experience with new innovations to continue building systems that empower people and communities around the world.

As I continue this journey, I'm gradually shifting my focus to paying forward my decades of experience by creating more educational content and tutorials for the next generation of developers. While I still enjoy some hands-on coding, my passion is now guiding others on best practices and principles that have served me well throughout my career. 

My goal is to leverage my expertise to help develop the young talents who will shape the future of technology. By volunteering as a mentor, open-sourcing code, speaking at events, and offering private tutoring, I am giving back to the communities with my commitment to empowering future developers. I'm excited to see where our combined potential takes us.

Let's Go! ðŸŽ“
