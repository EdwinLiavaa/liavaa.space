In my previous blog [post](https://github.com/EdwinLiavaa/liavaa.space/blob/main/blog/20250112/20250112.md), I explored the centralization paradox in Web3, highlighting how Bitcoin stands alone as truly decentralized digital cash. Today, I want to share my personal journey through the cryptocurrency landscape, a journey that has brought me full circle back to Bitcoin.

Like many in the blockchain space, I was captivated by the promise of new platforms and their ambitious visions. My exploration took me through the entire spectrum of Web3 technologies: Ethereum's smart contract capability, Polkadot's interoperability dreams, Cosmos's internet of blockchains, Hedera's hashgraph technology, Solana's speed-focused approach, Ripple's banking solutions, Avalanche's subnet architecture, Rootstock's Bitcoin-anchored innovation, and Chainlink's decentralized oracle networks connecting blockchain to real-world data.

Each platform offered something unique: faster transactions, smart contract capabilities, cross-chain communication, or novel consensus mechanisms. These features were exciting, innovative, and seemed to push the boundaries of what blockchain technology could achieve. Yet as I delved deeper into each ecosystem, a pattern emerged, one that echoed the concerns I raised in my previous article about centralized control masquerading as decentralization.

The truth revealed itself gradually. Behind each new protocol's technical innovations lay familiar corporate structures, venture capital influence, and centralized decision-making processes. While these projects built impressive technology stacks and attracted substantial investment, they inadvertently recreated the very power structures that Bitcoin was designed to circumvent.

This realization wasn't immediate. It came through years of hands-on experience, watching governance decisions unfold, observing token distributions, and seeing how protocol changes were really made. The more I learned, the more I understood that Bitcoin's simplicity, its singular focus on being decentralized electronic cash was not a limitation but its greatest strength.

Bitcoin's apparent "limitations" are actually carefully chosen design decisions that protect its core value proposition: truly decentralized money. No token sales, no venture capital rounds, no foundation controlling development, no team that can unilaterally change the rules. Just pure peer-to-peer electronic cash, maintained by a global network of participants who all play by the same rules.

This understanding has led me to my next chapter. I'm excited to announce my participation in the [Bitcoin Talents](https://web3-talents.io/bitcoin-talents/) program with the [Frankfurt School of Finance & Management Blockchain Center](https://www.frankfurt-school.de/home/research/centres/blockchain). Starting January 22, 2025, I'll be joining Cohort 4 of this prestigious program, not as a student but as a mentor. This role represents more than just a professional step, it's a commitment to helping others understand Bitcoin's unique value proposition and fostering the next generation of Bitcoin leaders.

The program's focus on empowering ambitious innovators in the Bitcoin space perfectly aligns with my journey and convictions. After exploring the entire landscape of Web3, I've come to believe that mentoring others in Bitcoin-specific innovation is the most impactful way to contribute to this technology's future.

Some might view this as a step backward, choosing to focus on the first and oldest cryptocurrency rather than the newest, shiniest blockchain platforms. But I see it differently. Bitcoin's simplicity and singular focus are its strengths. Its resistance to feature bloat and centralized control isn't a bug, it's the feature that matters most.

Looking ahead, I'm excited to share my experiences and insights with the next generation of Bitcoin innovators. My journey through the complexity of various Web3 platforms has given me a unique perspective on Bitcoin's value proposition. I understand not just what Bitcoin is, but what it isn't, and why those limitations are crucial to its success.

The future of Bitcoin isn't about competing with other blockchains in a feature race. It's about maintaining and strengthening its core promise: decentralized, censorship-resistant money for the world. As I step into my role as a mentor in the Bitcoin Talents program, I'm committed to helping others understand this fundamental truth and build upon it in meaningful ways.

For those beginning their own journey in the cryptocurrency space, I offer this advice: explore, learn, and question everything. But remember that sometimes the simplest solution, the one that stays true to its original purpose is the most resilient of all. Bitcoin taught us this in 2008, and it remains true today.
