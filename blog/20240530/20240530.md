# Who's at the Table? Consumers Should be First in "High Level" Discussions

When major industry players gather for "high level meetings" under banners like telecommunication associations or utilities consortiums, there's often one critical voice missing from the table - the consumer. These exclusive forums, funded by hefty membership fees from operators and vendors, tend to prioritize the commercial interests of private companies over the needs of the people they claim to serve.

Take the telecommunications sector as an example. The last time internet prices meaningfully decreased for consumers in Tonga was back in 2018. As the former CEO of Tonga Cable Ltd, the nationwide submarine fiber optic cable operator, I spearheaded a visionary 50% discount on wholesale price. The goal? Enabling affordable data access for all, with projections showing retail prices could drop as low as TOP$1 per GB.

Fast forward to 2024, and not only has that promise failed to materialize, but data remains exorbitantly expensive. Customers like myself are forced to obsessively monitor and disable data connections just to keep costs under control. Where was the consumer's voice advocating for sustained affordability amid all the "high level meetings"?

The sad truth is the average person is routinely left out of discussions that shape the very utilities and services they rely on daily. From telecommunications policy to energy regulations, these conversations happen behind closed doors between industry heavyweights and regulators - conversations paid for by consumer subscription fees lining association pockets.

Nowhere is the consumer, the actual prioritized stakeholder, given a seat at the table. Instead, corporate interests bend working groups and committees to lobby for policies that pad their bottom lines, not benefit households. Competitive pressures get quashed in cozy shared monologues about "challenges" facing entire industries.

It's a fundamentally misaligned system replicating itself across sectors. Associations formed to "represent" utilities increasingly exist to advance the interests of suppliers over consumers. The more money companies pour into memberships, the more sway they accumulate traducent grassroots interests.

Perhaps this dynamic explains the anemic growth, glacial innovation, and detached leadership plaguing many utility markets. There's simply no true accountability or commitment to customer-centric outcomes when consumers lack structured representation in governing dialogues. These "high level" circles prioritize vendor voices over the public they're meant to serve.

The rapid success of Starlink illustrates the pent-up demand for alternatives when legacy providers fail to adapt. Why are customer-championing offerings like this excluded from industry conversations that routinely handicap competitive pressures? Could it be that disruptive pro-consumer voices threaten the clubby, cozy relationship between traditional utilities and their expensive associations?

If utility provisioning is to truly put people over profits, it's time to renovate the way governing policy gets forged. We need enforceable, structured remits providing legitimate seats for consumer representatives in all "high level" discussions. Institutional counterweights to the millions spent buying association membership and lobbying leverage.

Because at the end of the day, consumers aren't stupid. We can see when growth priorities and innovation miss the mark on our real needs. We recognize the difference between an industry advocacy group and a consumer advocacy mandate. One represents a small team of companies protecting entrenched revenue streams. The other elevates the voices of the public they exist to empower.

It's time we redesigned the whole system to put consumers rightfully back at the top of the value chain. Only by centering grassroots interests in policy formation will we architect utilities capable of delivering on affordability, access and transformative services for all.
