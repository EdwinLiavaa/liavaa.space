In a recent development, Tonga is set to gain a second international submarine cable, the Tonga Hawaiki Branch System, thanks to a joint NZ$42 million (USD$32 million) investment by Australia and New Zealand. This new cable promises to improve redundancy and reduce the risk of outages, providing more resilience for Tonga's communications.

On the surface, this seems like a step in the right direction. But, as we all know, the devil is always in the last mile and in the details. The question on everyone's mind is: "will this new cable lead to cheaper internet tariffs and more affordable internet connectivity for the general public?"

As I've said before, the consumers are not stupid. We know that the grant will cover the CAPEX, but it's the Operations & Maintenance Cost (OPEX) that we need to worry about. Who will foot the bill for maintaining this new infrastructure? Will it be the consumers, yet again, who will have to bear the burden of keeping the lights on?

I'm not convinced that this new cable is the solution to Tonga's internet woes. In fact, I still believe that a decentralized microgrid model, powered by renewable energy sources and enabled by blockchain technology, is the way forward. This model empowers citizens to generate their own energy and provide their own Starlink internet connectivity, free from the shackles of centralized utility companies.

The problem with relying on centralized infrastructure is that it creates a dependencies on a single point of failure. With decentralized microgrids, we can create a resilient and redundant system that is less prone to outages and more adaptable to changing circumstances.

So, while I welcome the new submarine cable as a step forward, I remain skeptical about its ability to deliver affordable and reliable internet connectivity to the people of Tonga. The real solution lies in empowering citizens to take control of their own energy and internet needs, and that's a vision that I will continue to advocate for.
