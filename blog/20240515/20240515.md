In my previous post on April 21st, "[Prompt Engineering: Unleashing the Power of Generative AI for the Pasifika Wayfinders](https://github.com/EdwinLiavaa/liavaa.space/blob/main/blog/20240421/20240421.md)", I encouraged our Tongan and Pacific communities to seize the opportunity that generative AI presents. By mastering prompting skills, we can more effectively guide AI to elevate our voices and narratives.

There are valid concerns, however, that AI and automation could make existing jobs obsolete. But history shows technological revolutions ultimately create more jobs than they destroy. The industrial revolution transformed society, enabling new industries rather than eliminating workers.

Similarly, generative AI has immense potential to augment and empower humans rather than replace us. By offloading repetitive tasks to AI, we free up time for more creative, strategic, and uniquely human endeavors. Prompt engineering skills allow us to precisely direct AI capabilities to our needs.

The humans who develop prompting skills and learn to work symbiotically with AI will be in high demand. Businesses will need to ethically deploy AI for maximum value. Governments will rely on human-guided AI for critical decision support. AI will not replace humans, but humans with AI skills will replace those without.

Just as our ancestors pioneered wayfinding, we can pioneer shaping ethical AI development. Generative AI creates opportunities for our Pacific communities like:

* Generating culturally-relevant content and narratives
* Analyzing data through a Pacific lens
* Exploring innovative AI applications fusing ancient wisdom with new tech
* Upskilling for AI-related jobs across industries

Generative AI represents a chance to reclaim agency over technology. With prompting training, we can shape the AI tools determining how societies develop.

The industrial revolution didn't make workers obsolete, and the AI revolution promises new meaningful work categories. Those literate in prompting and ethical AI deployment will be innovators, policymakers and modern-day wayfinders.

Let's come together to unleash generative AI's potential for the collective wellbeing of our islands. The revolution will be AI-powered, and it will be Pasifika-led.
