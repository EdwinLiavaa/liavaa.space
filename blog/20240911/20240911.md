In the heart of the South Pacific, a quiet revolution is brewing. As a Tech practitioner with over 30 years of experience, I've had the privilege of witnessing firsthand how the youth of Tonga could chart a course towards a sustainable future that could serve as a model for island nations worldwide.

On a warm August day in 2024, I found myself presenting at the Tonga Youth ICT Symposium, hosted by the Tonga Women in ICT (TWICT). The enthusiasm in the room was palpable as I shared a compelling calculation that would captivate the audience and ignite a spark of possibility.

"Our nation's total usable roof space," I revealed, "could accommodate over 3.6 million solar panels, generating a staggering 2.6 billion kWh of clean electricity annually. This is over 37 times greater than Tonga's electricity net consumption of just 70 million kWh in 2022.[1]"

The revelation sent a ripple of excitement through the young attendees. For our nation, grappling with the immediate threats of climate change, this untapped potential represented more than just energy independence, it symbolized a pathway to true empowerment.

As I looked around the room, I couldn't help but wonder: why haven't our government's renewable energy specialists and the team at Tonga Power Ltd already seized upon this opportunity? The Tonga Renewable Energy Roadmap, launched with much fanfare a few years ago, promised to transform our energy landscape. But all too often, these grand initiatives have benefited only select vendors and contractors, with little tangible impact on the lives of everyday Tongans.

This is where I saw the power of a decentralized digital micro future becoming crucial. I outlined my vision to the attendees: communities generating, storing, and trading their own renewable energy, all managed through blockchain-based smart contracts. This wasn't just a technological solution; it was a reimagining of Tonga's social and economic fabric.

"Imagine a world," I explained, "where every community has the ability to generate, store, and trade their own renewable energy, all while using blockchain-based smart contracts to ensure transparency and equitable distribution." I felt the concept struck a chord with the young audience, their nods of approval encouraging me to continue.

Eventhough I did not find the time to interview the participants after my session, my vision resonates well with youth like Madeline Lavemai, a member of the Pacific Island Students Fighting Climate Change (PISFCC), who has been vocal about youth involvement in climate action. In a recent statement, she emphasized, "Now, more than ever, young people must be a part of climate conversations and action in Tonga" [2]. Her sentiment echoed the urgency I felt in empowering our youth to take ownership of their energy systems.

Likewise for Siosiua Veikune, a youth delegate who represented Tonga at COP27, has also been pushing for greater youth involvement. He asserts, "To see greater actual implementation of climate action the youth need to be more than just a mouthpiece; we need to also be physically involved in the actual processes" [2]. His words underscored the need for meaningful youth participation in climate initiatives, aligning perfectly with my vision.

To sum it all up, Lord Fakafanua's message commemorating International Youth Day 2024 further reinforced the importance of what we were discussing at the symposium. He emphasized, "By investing in digital skills and ensuring equitable access to technology, we empower our youth to succeed," adding, "As the future of Tonga, youth have an important role in promoting the well-being of our community in the digital age" [3]. His words highlight the crucial intersection of technology and youth empowerment in shaping Tonga's sustainable future.

As I concluded my presentation, I saw that the symposium had served as more than just a platform for ideas; it was a catalyst for action. Young Tongans from various backgrounds, engineers, entrepreneurs, and community organizers approached me with excitement. They recognized that the path to true self-determination lay not in waiting for top-down solutions, but in taking matters into their own hands.

I am also quoting Akesiu Leua Fita, Head of the Mitigation Division under the Department of Climate Change, has shared her thoughts on the critical role of youth in shaping Tonga's future: "Their energy, ideas, and commitment are catalysts for change, so by empowering our young leaders, we nurture a sense of ownership, driving innovative solutions to climate challenges" [2]. Her words reflect the growing recognition of youth potential in driving sustainable development.

As I left the symposium, the air buzzed with possibility. The youth of Tonga had glimpsed a future where our nation's natural resources could be harnessed not for the benefit of a privileged few, but for the collective prosperity of all. Through the fusion of renewable energy, blockchain technology, and community-driven initiatives, we can pursue a path to resilience in the face of climate change and economic uncertainty.

The story of Tonga's youth and their embrace of this vision for a decentralized, sustainable future is more than just a local narrative, it's a beacon of hope for island nations worldwide. As we continue to work towards realizing this vision, our journey serves as a powerful reminder of the transformative potential that lies at the intersection of technology, sustainability, and youth empowerment.

The time for action is now, and I'm confident that together, we can build a Tonga that is truly resilient, equitable, and responsive to the needs of all its citizens. As the world watches, Tonga's youth are not just adapting to the future, they are actively shaping it, one solar panel and blockchain transaction at a time.
