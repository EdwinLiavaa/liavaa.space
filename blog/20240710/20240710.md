In light of the recent directive from Starlink to disable service in Tonga, it is evident that the country's connectivity challenges have taken an unexpected turn. According to the message from Starlink, the Ministry of Meteorology, Energy, Information, Disaster Management, Environment, Climate Change and Communications (MEIDECC) has ordered the disabling of Starlink services, citing the need for "necessary regulatory approvals" to operate in our island nation.

This directive from MEIDECC raises concerns about the underlying factors driving this decision. As highlighted in my previous blog post, the frequency of submarine cable disruptions in Tonga's dynamic maritime environment, with three incidents in the past five years, underscores the vulnerability of the existing infrastructure. The probability of another cable break occurring is alarmingly high, estimated at 60% chance based on the past five-year period.

In this context, the move to block Starlink's satellite-based internet service raises questions about the Tonga government's priorities and the potential conflict of interest within the industry. MEIDECC's press conference on 5 July 2024 highlights the decision to disable Starlink may be driven by the government's role as both the Telecommunications Regulator and the majority shareholder in both Tonga Cable Ltd (TCL) - wholersale provider and Tonga Communications Corporation (TCC) - retail provider. Coincidently conflicting, it should also be worth mentioning that both retail service providers, TCC (100% Tonga Government owned) and Digicel are also shareholders in the wholesale provider TCL as a "duopoly".

This potential conflict of interest raises concerns about the government's objectivity in regulating the telecommunications sector and its willingness to explore alternative connectivity solutions, such as satellite technology. Satellite-based internet, exemplified by Starlink, has the potential to offer a more resilient and adaptable solution, capable of mitigating the risks associated with the island nation's seismic and underwater volcanic activities.

By blocking Starlink, the Tonga government may be prioritizing its own business interests over the broader needs of the people, potentially depriving them of a reliable backup option for internet connectivity. This decision could further widen the digital divide, particularly in the remote communities of Vava'u and Ha'apai, which have been adversely affected by the recent submarine cable disruption.

As Tonga navigates this connectivity conundrum, it is crucial for the government to prioritize the well-being of its citizens and adopt a more transparent and inclusive approach to telecommunications regulation. The exploration of alternative solutions, such as Starlink satellite technology, should be undertaken with a focus on ensuring reliable and equitable access to the internet, rather than protecting the business interests of state-owned enterprises.

Ultimately, Tonga's ability to bridge the digital divide and foster sustainable development will hinge on its capacity to navigate this complex landscape, balancing the needs of its people with the realities of its unique geographical and environmental challenges. The Starlink saga serves as a stark reminder of the delicate balance between technological innovation, regulatory oversight, and the pursuit of the public good.
