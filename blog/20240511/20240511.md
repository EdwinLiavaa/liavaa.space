In my previous post about staying connected to my mission of ensuring no one is left behind from the digital world, even in retirement, I mentioned the vital role new providers like SpaceX's Starlink can play in improving internet access across the Pacific islands. During my current work here in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), I've had the opportunity to experience Starlink's impact on underserved communities - and I'm incredibly impressed with its potential as a connectivity solution for our scattered island context.

Reliable, high-speed broadband has long been an infrastructural hurdle for remote Pacific communities. While undersea fiber optic submarine cables are making strides in connecting the main islands, that last mile distribution to outer islands and rural areas remains the biggest bottleneck. That's where a modern satellite internet constellation like Starlink is currently set to be a game-changer.

With Starlink, all you need is a user terminal installed on your rooftop or premises accompanied by a router wifi access point. I am totally blessed to be affiliated with other Pasifika Wayfinder's who are instrumental in rolling out Starlink terminals across the multiple outer islands in FSM, from the most developed areas all the way to the least developed, most isolated villages lacking any previous connectivity. Within 20 minutes, people's devices are suddenly connected to the global internet with speeds rivaling modern cable/fiber networks.

Compared to previous satellite internet solutions like Kacific, Starlink is much more cost-effective. Moreover, the plug-and-play simplicity and mobility of Starlink's hardware are ideally suited for the Pacific islands' dispersed geography. My affiliations and myself were all involved in rolling out Kacific's foot-print in the Pacific but moving a Kacific terminal between different sites as needed was not easy and quite challenging. But with Starlink, the installation can be handled by minimally-trained local technicians, putting connectivity provisioning in community hands as easy as in plug-n-play.

Most importantly, Starlink breaks the infrastructure bottleneck of that costly "last mile" to underserved areas. Whereas previous satellite solutions required massive up-front investment in ground infrastructure like teleports and gateways, Starlink does not need local ground facilities to work, and can be deployed anywhere. The entire global network is in orbit, removing major capital barriers.

This dramatically improves the economics and accessibility of high-performance connectivity for underserved Pacific communities. Reliable broadband can now be delivered in a commercially viable way to areas legacy telecoms have long struggled to serve profitably with terrestrial infrastructure alone.

But the key to unlocking Starlink's potential is energy access - an area I touched on in my previous post. You need electricity to power those user terminals and receive the internet signal. This is where initiatives to deploy renewable microgrids and home solar systems become crucial complementary infrastructure.

With a solar array and battery storage solution in place, Starlink terminals can operate indefinitely with no need for grid power or diesel gensets. Clean energy and space-based internet, operating in symbiosis to provide remote communities modern connectivity and electricity access in one integrated resilient system.

I'm excited about the possibilities of combining Starlink's capabilities with ongoing renewable energy deployments to holistically upgrade Pacific island infrastructure. Climate-resilient systems powered by solar, wind and satellite broadband can leapfrog legacy constraints.

Of course, there are challenges to be addressed around affordability, supply chains, technical support and sustainability. But the underlying Starlink technology itself appears to be the robust, scalable solution we've needed. Leveraged properly alongside energy access efforts, it could significantly accelerate our mission of closing the digital divide.

My personal experience using Starlink out here has sold me on its transformative potential for the Pacific islands. I'm able to connect everywhere I go and work seamlessly with high-bandwidth connectivity from even the least expected locations. That level of mobility and performance would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.

So while I may be "retired" from the corporate world, I remain energized to explore emerging technologies like Starlink that can uplift underserved communities across our Blue Pacific continent. Because our mission of achieving universal meaningful connectivity for all must forge ahead - one overlooked village at a time.
