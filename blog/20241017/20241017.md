### Abstract: [here](https://github.com/EdwinLiavaa/liavaa.space/blob/main/blog/20241017/Abstract.pdf) 

As we gear up for the Pacific Islands GIS & RS Users Conference from 25-29 November, 2024, we're excited to share a sneak peek into our upcoming presentation. Our journey as Pasifika wayfinders in the realm of geospatial technology has led us to some groundbreaking discoveries in utilities asset management and disaster risk resilience.

## The Power of FOSS4G in the Pacific

Remember when proprietary software vendors warned us to "be very careful" about open-source alternatives? Well, those days are long gone! Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial applications (FOSS4G) has become the backbone of our work, particularly in our recent ADB Renewable Energy Development Project in the Federated States of Micronesia.

QGIS and QField, our dynamic duo of open-source GIS tools, have transformed how we approach critical tasks:

1. Mapping vital infrastructure like power plants and transmission lines
2. Modeling potential impacts from cyclones, flooding, and other natural hazards
3. Conducting efficient field surveys, even in the most remote Pacific islands

The best part? These powerful tools align perfectly with our values of community empowerment and accessibility. In the Pacific Island context, where resources can be limited, FOSS4G offers a path to build local technical capacity without breaking the bank.

## Introducing the Game-Changers: GNSS X5 Mobile PRO and Starlink Mini

But wait, there's more! We're thrilled to introduce two new players in our geospatial toolkit: the GNSS X5 Mobile PRO and Starlink Mini. These innovations are revolutionizing how we collect and transmit high-precision data in the field, especially in remote locations.

### GNSS X5 Mobile PRO

Imagine a device that weighs just 45 grams (that's lighter than a chicken egg!) yet delivers centimeter-level accuracy. The X5 Mobile PRO does just that, and it's compatible with your smartphone. Here's why we're excited about it:

- Supports PPK, RTK, and NTRIP modes for versatile surveying
- Works within a 10km radius in RTK mode or up to 70km in NTRIP mode
- Offers an affordable solution for high-precision mapping

### Starlink Mini

Now, pair that with Starlink Mini – a game-changing satellite internet solution perfect for our island nations:

- Compact and portable: At just 11.4 x 9.8 inches, it's about the size of a small laptop
- Fast speeds: Delivers up to 100Mbps download speeds, even in remote areas
- Low latency: With just 23ms latency, it's suitable for real-time data transmission
- Affordable: Expected to cost around $299, making it accessible for more users
- Easy setup: Takes less than 5 minutes to get online

For our Pacific Island utilities, this combination means access to professional-grade surveying capabilities and high-speed internet at a fraction of the cost of traditional systems. Imagine conducting high-precision surveys on a remote island and instantly uploading your data to the cloud – that's the power of X5 Mobile PRO and Starlink Mini working together.

## Charting a Resilient Future

By combining the power of FOSS4G tools like QGIS and QField with affordable, high-precision hardware like the X5 Mobile PRO and Starlink Mini, we're not just mapping utilities – we're charting a course towards more resilient and self-reliant Pacific Island communities.

As we face the challenges of climate change and natural disasters, these tools become our modern wayfinding instruments, guiding us towards a more secure and sustainable future. They enable us to collect, analyze, and share critical data even in the most remote locations, ensuring that our island nations are better prepared and more connected than ever before.

We can't wait to dive deeper into these topics at the upcoming conference. If you're attending the Pacific Islands GIS & RS Users Conference, be sure to catch our presentation. Let's navigate this exciting future of geospatial technology together!

See you in November!
