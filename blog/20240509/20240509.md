In my previous blog on the 2 April 2024, I discussed the transformative potential of technologies like Starlink to bridge connectivity gaps across the Pacific islands. However, satellite broadband is just one part of the solution - resilient renewable energy systems are the other crucial piece of uplifting our islands into the modern digital era.

This point was reinforced when I came across the recent [article](https://matangitonga.to/2024/05/07/tonga-power-invest-millions-services) by Matangi Tonga stating that Tonga Power Ltd (TPL) to invest around $45 million pa'anga in upgrading their centralized power generation and distribution infrastructure over the next fiscal year. While the intentions of enhancing energy access and reliability are laudable, I think this doubling down on a traditional top-down utility model misses an opportunity to leapfrog into the future.

The 21st century reality is that centralized, fossil fuel-based energy systems are becoming increasingly obsolete and unsustainable. Frequent outages, high operational costs, vulnerability to disruptions - these are all symptoms of being overly reliant on outdated approaches. The future is decentralized, renewable, and democratized access through interconnected smart microgrids.

During my current engagement with the renewable energy development project disaster risk reduction consultancy work across the Federated States of Micronesia, I've been blessed to learn from renowned energy engineers and advisors in my team. Moreover, I've been able to wrap my mind around frameworks for electric utilities to transition towards this microgrid model. By deploying distributed renewable energy systems at the community level, we can simultaneously improve energy security, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and put power generation directly into the hands of the people as prosumers.

The key enabling technology underpinning this microgrid revolution is blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLT). Blockchain provides the secure, transparent, and automated platform to seamlessly track and settle the multidirectional flows of electricity and payments between prosumers, consumers, utilities, and other players.

Just as cryptocurrencies allow frictionless peer-to-peer value transfer without intermediaries, blockchain-based energy markets facilitate real-time trading and sharing of renewable power across a network of interconnected microgrids. Households and businesses can buy and sell their surplus solar energy on dynamically priced markets, enabled by smart contracts on the blockchain.

When combined with complementary technologies like energy storage, electric vehicles, and smart grids, this creates an ecosystem of distributed energy resources collectively managed as a unified resilient system. One where communities aren't vulnerable to a single point of failure, and have a direct stake in both the costs and resilience of their power infrastructure.

The advantages don't stop there - blockchain's inherent qualities of data integrity, transparency and security are pivotal for key functions like cybersecurity, autonomous automation, and managing vulnerabilities from climate impacts or disasters. Its decentralized architecture prevents service disruptions from targeted attacks.

There are already pilot projects like the [Brooklyn Microgrid](https://www.brooklyn.energy/brooklyn-microgrid/) successfully demonstrating this blockchain-enabled transactive energy model. The technological foundations have been laid - now we must replicate and scale these initiatives across the Pacific Islands.

Rather than sinking more investment into antiquated centralized power plants and grids, a wiser path could be catalyzing development of distributed microgrids using renewable sources like solar, wind, bioenergy and ocean energy. Leveraged alongside broadband internet and digital services powered by next-gen solutions like Starlink, this interconnected microgrid infrastructure becomes the launchpad for economic renaissance across the Blue Pacific.

I understand inertia and incumbency are powerful forces resistant to change. Rethinking entire energy systems is daunting. But our Islands cannot afford to be left behind in outmoded, unsustainable 20th century models as the world undergoes this transformation. We must embrace the inevitability of decentralization and empower our communities through locally-owned, blockchain-enabled clean energy microgrids.

In this transition, my role is to advocate for and help design these new resilient and democratized microgrid ecosystems. To build capacity within utilities and government agencies for managing interconnected microgrids and maximizing services to remote communities currently left behind.

The upfront investments required will be offsetted by their proposed cost of $45 million pa'anga to upgrade the current centralized model. Moreover, the long-term benefits of local ownership, resilience, sustainability and energy affordability make blockchain-enabled microgrids a future-proof path the Pacific must seriously explore. Our Islands' pursuit of truly meaningful connectivity and energy democracy requires nothing less than this decentralized energy revolution.

Crucially, this model can provide relief from the punishingly high electricity tariffs currently burdening Pacific islanders. In Tonga, residential customers are paying a crippling 106.18 seniti per kWh with TPL's centralized, diesel-dependent generation. A decentralized renewable microgrid system could slash those rates by 15-20%, bringing costs down to around 90 seniti per kWh through fuel savings alone.

Factor in the economic impacts of locally-produced and owned energy, transactive energy markets offering least-cost power trading, and revenue streams to prosumers, and households could see even more dramatic reductions in perpetually rising power bills. Energy democracy enables energy affordability.

Our Islands' pursuit of truly meaningful connectivity and energy democracy requires nothing less than this decentralized energy revolution. The socioeconomic benefits of resilient, sustainable, and lower-cost electrification are simply too compelling to ignore. While incumbent models die a slow death, our future lies in the inevitable march towards interconnected renewable microgrids securely orchestrated by blockchain technologies.

The least I could have done, if I was CEO ;)
