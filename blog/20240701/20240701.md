In light of the recent announcement by Tonga's Department of Communications, MEIDECC, regarding the current offline status of the domestic submarine cable connecting the islands of Vava'u and Ha'apai, it is prudent to re-evaluate the optimal connectivity solution for the island nation.

The press release cites the "causes of the disruption to the cable" as still unknown, hinting at the persistent challenge of maintaining reliable submarine cable infrastructure in a region prone to seismic and volcanic activity. This raises an important question: is the submarine fiber optic cable truly the best approach for Tonga's connectivity needs?

Let's examine the probability of such cable severance events occurring. This is the third such incident in the past five years from 2019 to 2024, suggesting a probability of 0.6 or 60% of the same event happening again. This high probability underscores the vulnerability of submarine cables in Tonga's dynamic maritime environment.

As an alternative, satellite broadband technology, such as Starlink, could offer a more resilient and adaptable solution. Satellite-based internet is not susceptible to the same risks as submarine cables, making it a potentially more reliable backup option. Additionally, the rapid advancements in satellite technology have significantly improved the performance and affordability of this connectivity option.

Furthermore, the use of satellite broadband could provide more comprehensive coverage across Tonga's widely dispersed islands, ensuring that even the remote communities in Vava'u and Ha'apai have access to reliable internet connectivity. This is particularly important in the context of the country's efforts to bridge the digital divide and promote digital transformation.

In conclusion, while submarine fiber optic cables have been the traditional solution for Tonga's connectivity, the frequency of disruptions and the high probability of future cable severance events suggest the need for a re-evaluation of the optimal approach. Satellite broadband, such as Starlink, could emerge as a more resilient and adaptable alternative, offering a reliable backup to the existing submarine cable infrastructure and expanding internet access to even the most remote regions of the archipelago. As Tonga continues to navigate the challenges of maintaining its digital connectivity, exploring innovative solutions like satellite technology could be the key to ensuring a more robust and sustainable communications landscape for the island nation.
