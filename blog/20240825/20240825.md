It's been one month since I joined the [HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com) team as a Web3 Bounty Writer, and what an incredible journey it has been so far. As an engineer by trade, I was drawn to the world of Bitcoin and its underlying technology, proof of work, which I believe can serve as an emancipation engine with a unique political use case model. I am excited to share my personal convictions on these topics and provide a glimpse into the future potential of this revolutionary technology.

When I am named the "HackerNoon Web 3 Writer Of the Day" not once, not twice, but three times within my first month, including today. As I woke up this morning to find myself with a message from the HackerNoon team on our first anniversary, I took it as a sign that I truly have something valuable to offer this space. It is a humbling and exciting achievement that has only fueled my passion to continue exploring and sharing my insights on the transformative power of Bitcoin and Web3.

As the HackerNoon team mentioned on LinkedIn, "How [Edwin Liava'a](https://hackernoon.com/u/edwinliavaa) shows enthusiasm publishing and participating in one of our Writing Contests is truly special, dreams do come true when you challenge yourself, and just willing to share your talent with the world".

I know we are often advised to keep our success stories quiet, to avoid potential negative reactions from the world around us. But I simply don't care. I'm not here to boast about my achievements - I'm here to share my progress, to offer a glimpse into what the future holds, and to inspire others who may be on a similar journey.

The world of Bitcoin and Web3 is rapidly evolving, and I believe we are just scratching the surface of its vast potential. Through my writing and participation in the HackerNoon community, I hope to not only share my own insights and experiences, but also to learn from the brilliant minds and diverse perspectives of others who are equally passionate about this transformative technology.

So here's to the next chapter, the next milestone, the next dream realized. I'm excited to continue this journey, to push the boundaries of what's possible, and to play a role in shaping the future of Bitcoin, Web3, and beyond. Dream big, challenge yourself, and be willing to share your talent with the world - because dreams really can come true.

Happy Anniversary HackerNoon! Let's Go!
