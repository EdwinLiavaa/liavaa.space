### The Reality Check We Needed

This is indeed a great start, we are finally heading in the right direction. Yes, in this day and age, Information Security (Infosec) is common practice. Moreover, we now have the [Government's Digital Transformation and Cybersecurity Frameworks](https://digitaltransformation.gov.to/) published online.

However, three official major attacks in 2+ years signifies that our greatest strength is still our weakest link i.e. the human aspect.

- **TCC (Tonga Communications Corporation) - 2023** - Medusa ransomware
- **MOH (Ministry of Health) - 2025** - INC Ransom attack
- **TPL (Tonga Power Limited) - 2025** - Recent incident

Having said that, we have our policies in place, but we all know that adhering to policy discussions only camouflages technical incompetencies. Therefore, let's put our Engineers hats "ON" and dig deeper to find out our vulnerabilities as root causes of our problems.

## The Harsh Truth - Policy ≠ Protection

While Tonga has made commendable progress in establishing cybersecurity frameworks and digital transformation policies, the stark reality is that paper shields don't stop digital bullets. Three major cyberattacks in just over two years isn't bad luck, it's a systemic failure of our cybersecurity infrastructure where both technical and human aspects are critical components.

### The Attack Timeline - A Pattern Emerges

**March 2023 - Tonga Communications Corporation (TCC)**
- **Attacker**: Medusa ransomware group
- **Impact**: Administrative systems compromised, customer service disrupted
- **Root Cause**: State owned telecommunication infrastructure vulnerability

**June 2025 - Ministry of Health (MOH)**
- **Attacker**: INC Ransom group
- **Impact**: Complete National Health Information System shutdown
- **Cost**: US$1 million ransom demand (unpaid)
- **Consequence**: Manual paper records across all four hospitals

**2025 - Tonga Power Limited (TPL)**
- **Details**: Recent incident under investigation
- **Concern**: Critical infrastructure targeting continues

## Technical Vulnerabilities - The Real Engineering Problem

Let's stop sugar-coating the situation with policy rhetoric and examine the actual technical deficiencies that enabled these attacks:

### 1. Legacy Infrastructure Exposure

**The Problem**: Some of Tonga's critical infrastructure relies heavily on outdated systems with known vulnerabilities.

**Technical Reality**:
- Unbatched Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) vulnerabilities 
- Heavy reliance on proprietary software stacks including Microsoft unpatched systems instead of taking a sovereignty approach with Linux, Open Office and Open Source solutions
- Insufficient network segmentation between critical systems
- Single points of failure across government networks
- Policy initiatives should be aligned accordingly so that what's on paper is aligned with what is installed

**Engineering Solution Required**: Complete infrastructure modernization with zero-trust architecture.

### 2. Inadequate Network Security Architecture

**The Problem**: While our government network infrastructure is well designed with SOC team management and vendor independence, the challenge lies in continuous monitoring with proactive rather than reactive response capabilities.

**Current Strengths**:
- Government network operations, management, and security handled by our SOC team using Government Core network equipment
- Deliberately designed to be secure, scalable, and free from vendor lock-in
- One of the 2 major telecom providers provides fiber service but has no control over the Government network
- Seamless ability to switch to alternative fiber service providers

**Technical Gaps to Address**:
- Enhanced micro-segmentation within government networks
- Strengthened monitoring and intrusion detection capabilities
- Advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) deployment
- 24/7 SOC capabilities expansion

**Engineering Solution Required**: Build upon our solid foundation with enhanced defense-in-depth, real time monitoring and automated response while maintaining our vendor independent approach.

### 3. Data Protection Failures

**The Problem**: Critical government data lacks proper encryption and access controls.

**Technical Deficiencies**:
- Unencrypted data at rest in government databases
- Weak authentication mechanisms (password only access)
- Insufficient backup and recovery capabilities
- No data loss prevention (DLP) systems

**Engineering Solution Required**: End-to-end encryption with hardware security modules and multi-factor authentication.

### 4. Incident Response Inadequacy

**The Problem**: When attacks occur, our response is reactive rather than proactive.

**Operational Gaps**:
- No automated incident response capabilities
- Dependence on external expertise (Australian cyber teams)
- Insufficient forensic capabilities for attack attribution
- Slow recovery times leading to extended service disruptions

**Engineering Solution Required**: 24/7 SOC with automated playbooks and local expertise.

## The Pacific Context - Why Small Islands Are Prime Targets

Cybercriminals aren't randomly selecting Tonga, we represent an attractive target profile:

### Target Characteristics
- **Limited Cybersecurity Resources**: Small and isolated CERT teams with limited resources but with huge responsibilities
- **Critical Infrastructure Concentration**: centralised systems controlling essential distributed services
- **Geographic Isolation**: Delayed incident response and limited local expertise
- **Economic Vulnerability**: Significant disruption from relatively small attacks
- **Digital Transformation Rush**: Rapid digitization without corresponding security investment

### Regional Pattern Analysis
The attacks on Tonga mirror a broader Pacific trend:
- **Vanuatu (2022)**: Complete government shutdown for over a month, ransomware attack on November 6, 2022
- **Palau (2025)**: Ministry of Health compromise by Qilin ransomware group on February 17, 2025

**Engineering Insight**: Pacific Island nations need specialized cybersecurity architectures designed for geographic and resource constraints.

## Update - Collaborative Engineering Consensus Reached

Following productive discussions with cybersecurity colleagues across government, we have reached consensus with the conclusion that our greatest strength is still our weakest link i.e. the human aspect.

### Recommended Enhancement Areas:

**Beyond Training:**
- Add automated patch management and behavioral monitoring
- Implement continuous user verification systems

**Network Segmentation:**
- Consider micro-segmentation within ministries
- Deploy zero-trust internal architecture

**SOC Capabilities:**
- 24/7 threat hunting and automated incident response
- Proactive threat intelligence integration

**Power and Backup Connectivity:**
- Independent government solar microgrids
- Satellite backup options for total outage scenarios

### The DePIN Implementation Path Forward

**Looking ahead:** The vendor independent approach aligns perfectly with the MEIDECC DSS and Performance Indicator Dashboard. This will demonstrate how distributed infrastructure can provide both resilience and independence from traditional vendor dependencies.

Our foundation is solid. We're moving from "adequate security" to "resilient security", which is exactly what we need given the targeted attacks we have experienced.

The government's scalable approach puts us in a great position for the DePIN infrastructure rollout.

## Conclusion: Engineering Our Digital Sovereignty

The three major cyberattacks on Tonga revealed a fundamental truth i.e our greatest strength i.e. our human aspect is also our weakest cybersecurity link. But this collaborative engineering approach demonstrates that we can transform this challenge into innovation.

**The engineering reality is now clear**: 
- Human factors remain our primary vulnerability
- DePIN infrastructure can provide technical resilience independent of human error
- Our vendor-independent architecture positions us for advanced implementation
- We have the team consensus needed for transformational change

**The collaborative path forward**:
- Implement automated systems to reduce human error impact
- Deploy DePIN infrastructure starting with MEIDECC
- Build resilient, energy-independent government networks
- Create the Pacific's most secure digital sovereignty model

As engineers and technologists working together, we have the opportunity to transform this crisis into the most innovative government infrastructure in the Pacific. The DePIN model will demonstrate that small island nations can achieve both digital sovereignty and cybersecurity resilience.

The question isn't whether we can afford to implement these solutions, it's whether we can afford not to lead this transformation.

*"Ko e Otua mo Tonga ko hotau tofi'a"* means our inheritance includes both our islands and our responsibility to protect them in the digital age. Let's stop talking about cybersecurity and start re-engineering it.
