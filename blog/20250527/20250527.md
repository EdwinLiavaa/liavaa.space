*A continuation of the Alpha Engineer's journey: Sometimes the most powerful lessons come not from acceptance, but from the clarity that rejection provides.*

---

This past week brought a constellation of experiences that perfectly embody everything I've written about regarding the Alpha Engineer's path. Three distinct outcomes that, when viewed through the lens of authentic building rather than external validation, tell a story about staying true to your mission regardless of what doors open or close.

## The Appointment - Tonga Cable Ltd. Chairman

With great solidarity from the Ministry of Public Enterprices (MPE), I was appointed as Chairman of the Board for Tonga Cable Ltd. This isn't just a title, it's a responsibility that sits squarely at the nexus of everything I've been building toward. Infrastructure. Connectivity. Tonga and the Pacific's digital sovereignty.

When I wrote about delaying my parliamentary run to focus on substantial building rather than political posturing, this appointment validates that approach. Leadership isn't about campaigning for positions, it's about demonstrating competence until others recognize your ability to serve.

Tonga Cable Ltd. represents critical infrastructure for our Tonga and the Pacific digital transformation. As Chairman, I'm not just overseeing operations, I'm helping shape how the Pacific connects to the global digital economy. Every decision we make affects our people's ability to participate in Web3, to access educational resources, to build their own digital futures.

This appointment came not because I asked for it, but because the work spoke first.

## The Google Interview - Testing Waters, Confirming Direction

I made it to the second round of interviews with Google for an internet infrastructure role. Despite receiving the news on the third call that I wasn't the best fit, I walked away more satisfied with my performance than disappointed by the outcome.

Why? Because this was never about becoming a Googler. This was about testing the waters.

The role caught my attention precisely because it was internet infrastructure focused, and we need those enablers for our blockchain solutions as a more secure layer on the internet infrastructure. But even as I progressed through their process, I knew this wasn't fully aligned with my current Web3 engagements.

Muhammad Ali taught us that you don't just fight to win every fight, you fight to understand your opponents, to test your skills, to clarify your own strengths. This Google interview was exactly that. A sparring session that confirmed my direction rather than diverting it.

The interview process revealed something crucial i.e. I'm exactly where I need to be. Building Pasifika, chairing Tonga Cable Ltd., working in Web3 infrastructure, these aren't stepping stones to something else. They're the destination itself.

## The ADB Opportunity - Blockchain Consultancy Under Review

The preliminary interview with the Asian Development Bank for a Blockchain Consultancy role is currently under review. Another opportunity that, regardless of outcome, serves to validate the path I'm already walking.

The fact that institutions like ADB are seeking blockchain expertise in the Pacific context proves what I've been saying in my previous articles i.e. the future won't be shaped by those who talk loudest about digital transformation, but by those who build it, implement it, and make it work for our people.

Whether this opportunity materializes or not, the conversation itself confirms that the work we're doing at Pasifika and in the broader Pacific Web3 ecosystem is not just relevant, it's necessary.

## The Alpha Engineer's Response to Outcomes

Here's why I'm writing about these developments with complete transparency i.e. Alpha Engineers don't hide from outcomes, positive or negative. We don't celebrate only the wins while quietly nursing the rejections. We understand that both acceptance and rejection are simply data points in the larger mission.

The Google rejection doesn't make me less qualified. The Tonga Cable appointment doesn't make me more valuable. The ADB review doesn't determine my worth. What matters is this i.e. Am I building something that serves people? Am I walking the talk? Are my actions speaking louder than any interviewer's assessment?

The answer remains yes.

## Walking the Talk - Actions Over Interviews

This transparency isn't about seeking sympathy or validation. It's about demonstrating a fundamental principle i.e. Alpha Engineers should not worry about the outcomes of interviews. Our job is to keep building regardless.

At the end of the day, what you build will speak for itself, and even louder regardless of what any interviewer thinks.

When Google said I wasn't the best fit, my immediate thought wasn't disappointment. It was clarity. Good. Now I can focus completely on what I'm already building without any competing loyalties or divided attention.

When I was appointed as Chairman of the Board for Tonga Cable Ltd., it wasn't validation of my worthiness. It was recognition of work already done, value already delivered, trust already earned through consistent action.

## The Transparency Imperative

I share these developments because Web3 demands radical transparency. In a space built on trustless systems and decentralized verification, hiding our processes and outcomes would be fundamentally hypocritical.

More importantly, other builders need to see that the path isn't linear. That rejection from one opportunity can coincide with acceptance for another. That your worth isn't determined by any single institution's assessment of your fit for their needs.

The Alpha Engineer's evolution continues not despite these mixed outcomes, but because of the clarity they provide.

## The Week's Real Victory

The real victory this week wasn't the appointment or surviving the interview rounds. It was the confirmation that I'm building something larger than any single opportunity.

Tonga Cable Ltd. benefits from leadership that understands both traditional infrastructure and emerging technologies. Google would have gotten a competent employee, but the Pacific gets a committed builder. For ADB, they will definitely get me as a consultant, and our communities gets me as someone who lives here, works here, builds here permanently.

Every "no" from institutions operating in the old paradigm is often a "yes" for the new one we're building.

## Looking Forward: The Building Continues

As I wrote in my manifesto about choosing to be loud, the noise shouldn't hinder your transition to being the best you can be. This week's experiences prove that principle in action.

The criticism, the rejection, the acceptance, they're all just noise. What matters is the signal i.e. consistent building, authentic service, and unwavering commitment to the mission.

Tomorrow I'll wake up and continue building Pasifika. I'll fulfill my responsibilities as Tonga Cable Chairman. I'll engage with the ADB process professionally regardless of the outcome. I'll keep writing content, cutting code, training people, and making Web3 accessible to Pacific communities.

Because that's what Alpha Engineers do. We build through rejection, we lead through service, and we measure success not by external validation, but by the value we create for others.

The journey continues. The destination remains clear. And every outcome, positive or negative, simply provides more fuel for the ascension.

*To my fellow Alpha Engineers i.e. Let your work speak first. Let institutions catch up to you, not the other way around. And when they don't, keep building anyway. The Pacific and the world needs what you're creating.*
