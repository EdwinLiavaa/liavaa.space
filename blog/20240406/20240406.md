In my Blog post on the 10 February 2024, I discussed the power of integrating AI tutoring tools like LLM Generative to enhance one-on-one learning experiences. However, my overarching mission in providing mentorship extends far beyond just supplementing education with helpful technology.

As I reflected on my previous piece, "Building awareness and providing resources to enable widespread adoption is equally vital" to solving the digital divide. My aim is to empower students, especially those from underserved communities, with the skills and self-reliance to thrive independently in our increasingly tech-driven world.

I don't believe in creating a dependency, where students perpetually rely on private tutoring to progress. That's akin to the capitalistic model of ensuring customers keep coming back, lining corporate pockets. My approach is the antithesis of that mindset.

Instead, I strive to be the catalyst that unlocks students' innate potential and passion for lifelong learning. I provide a solid conceptual foundation not only across STEM subjects but also in Economics. But more importantly, I equip students with the problem-solving abilities and self-confidence to continue exploring these topics autonomously.

My role is that of an empowerment coach - identifying knowledge gaps, customizing my instruction, and gradually transitioning ownership to the student through hands-on practice. The goal is for them to become self-driven learners who can navigate educational and career journeys through their own volition.

I received heartwarming feedback from a parent whose daughter I recently mentored that encapsulates this philosophy perfectly:

"My Daughter's First Private Maths & Computer Tutor. Mr. Edwin Liava'a! Appreciate his help. I can see improvement in her studies since taking this first 1-hour extra class.!"

Witnessing a student gain that self-assuredness to take the lead in their learning journey is the greatest reward a mentor can ask for. It's a pivotal moment when you can step back, confident that your pupil is equipped to soar on their own.

While AI tutoring companions are powerful facilitators, they cannot replace the human element of guidance, emotional support, and nurturing a student's intrinsic motivation. My role is providing that human touch - empowering the next generation with skills that transcend any single lesson.

In retirement, I've refocused my efforts on grassroots mentorship because I believe it's the most direct way to uproot systemic inequities. By building capacity through education that emphasizes self-reliance over dependency, we can uplift entire communities and democratize access to opportunities.

True fulfillment for me lies in seeing students gain those "aha!" moments of clarity, followed by the realization that they now possess the keys to unlock their own vast potential. That's the ultimate legacy I aim to leave through my mission of empowerment coaching.
