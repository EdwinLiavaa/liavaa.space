SpaceX's satellite internet service Starlink is utilizing lasers to transmit massive amounts of data between satellites. According to a SpaceX engineer, the system is currently beaming 42 million gigabytes per day using a network of 9,000 lasers across the Starlink constellation. This allows the satellites to relay data when ground stations are unavailable, reducing latency.

The robust laser system has achieved over 99% uptime despite the challenges of operating in space. With mobile compatibility coming soon, Starlink aims to provide high-speed satellite internet across the globe.

While impressive, it remains to be seen if space-based lasers will make submarine internet cables obsolete. The cables still have far greater capacity overall. There are also regulatory challenges ahead as roaming capabilities expand.

In any case, it is interesting times as companies like SpaceX push the boundaries to connect the world. The roll out of satellite mega constellations and advancing laser links promise a future of ubiquitous global internet coverage.
