It all started back in 2008-2012 when I was working at the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) in Suva, Fiji. During the financial crisis, I came across Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System [whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper), and it piqued my interest in this emerging technology. I dove deep into understanding the potential of decentralized digital currencies and the underlying blockchain technology.

However, like many, I became skeptical when I read about the shady activities on the [Silk Road](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-long-and-winding-story-of-silk-road-bitcoins-earliest-major-application) "Dark Web" platform. But that didn't deter me for long. After discovering the Ethereum [whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/) and the power of smart contracts, I regained my momentum and became increasingly passionate about the possibilities of blockchain.

Over the years, I've continued to expand my knowledge and skills, earning certifications in Blockchain, Smart Contracts, and AI. This commitment to personal development and continuous learning has been a driving force in my journey. The turning point came when I attended and presented a [Telco's Perspective on Blockchain](https://www.traseable.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/telco-perspective-edwin-liavaa.pdf) during the Pasifika Regional Blockchain [TechCamp](https://www.traseable.com/news/regional-blockchain-techcamp-2018/) in 2018 and inspired me to join the Chainlink Fall Hackathon 2021
and became a Top Quality Project Winner for my Blockchain/Chainlink : Satellite Broadband Service Chain [Project](https://devpost.com/software/blockchain-chainlink-satellite-broadband-supply-chain).

This event reignited my roadmap that have let me to being inspired to pursue my own [whitepaper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380904006_Decentralized_Micro-Governance_Model_for_the_Kingdom_of_Tonga_Based_on_Proof-of-Work_Consensus) on a Decentralized Micro-Governance Model for the Kingdom of Tonga, based on Proof-of-Work consensus. This work has also evolved into my latest project, the revival of [PasifikaOS](https://github.com/EdwinLiavaa/pasifikaos), an open-source operating system that aims to bring the benefits of blockchain technology to the Pacific region, in which I also submitted to the Bitcoin Games 2024 Hackathon as my "PasifikaOS Your Bitcoin Core Operating System" [Project](https://devpost.com/software/pasifikaos-iy8h2m).

Through this multifaceted journey, I've learned to navigate the complex and ever-evolving world of blockchain, constantly adapting and growing my expertise. From initial skepticism to unwavering passion, my pursuit of innovative solutions has been fueled by a deep commitment to personal development and a belief in the transformative power of this technology. 

I am now RED - Retired, Extremely Dexterous, keeping at it by sharing my insights as Mentor, Chainlink Developer Expert, and HackerNoon Web3 Bounty Writer. This has been a wild ride, but it's one fueled by an insatiable curiosity, a willingness to embrace change, and a steadfast belief that blockchain and Web3 hold the key to a more equitable, decentralized future.

And if in a 100 years from today in 2124, I am buried and forgotten, with my possessions owned by strangers who will not know or remember me. I hope to be remembered for my life's work on Bitcoin powered by Blockchain as an emancipation Engine.
