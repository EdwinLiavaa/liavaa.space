QGIS Cloud is a service that allows you to easily publish your QGIS projects and data on the web. It provides a web-based infrastructure for hosting your spatial data and maps, without requiring you to set up and maintain your own server infrastructure.

</p>

### 3.1 Prepare your QGIS Project

Begin by creating a QGIS project with the data and styling you want to publish. The example provided in the documentation used some Natural Earth data, which you can download and add to a new QGIS project.

### 3.2 Upload Data to QGIS Cloud

To publish your map, you first need to upload your data to the QGIS Cloud database. This is done through the "Load Data" tab of the QGIS Cloud plugin. Simply select the layers you want to upload and click the "Upload data" button.

### 3.3 Publish the Map
With your data uploaded, you can now publish your QGIS project to QGIS Cloud. Go to the "Maps" tab and click the "Publish Map" button. This will upload your project to the QGIS Cloud server.

### 3.4 Access the Published Map
After publishing, you will see your map listed in the "Published Maps" section. You can access the published map by clicking on the "Webmap" link, which will open the QGIS Cloud web client displaying your map.

## 4 Working with the QGIS Cloud Web Client

The QGIS Cloud web client provides a range of features for interacting with your published maps:

- Turning map layers on and off
- Adjusting layer transparency
- Changing the layer order
- Displaying layer legends
- Searching for locations and addresses
- Printing the map!

## 5. QGIS Cloud Pro Features

QGIS Cloud Pro offers additional features beyond the free account, including:

- Restricting access to your maps and data
- Defining custom scales for your maps
- Enabling WFS-T (Web Feature Service - Transactional) for editing data
- Accessing advanced map settings
- You can learn more about these Pro features in the [QGIS Cloud documentation](https://docs.qgiscloud.com/en/). 

## 6. Conclusion
QGIS Cloud provides an easy-to-use solution for publishing your QGIS projects and data on the web. By following the steps outlined in this user manual, you can quickly set up your QGIS Cloud environment and start sharing your maps with the world.
