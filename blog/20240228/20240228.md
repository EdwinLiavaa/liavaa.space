For nearly a decade, from 2012 to 2021 I worked on a project supporting PNG Power Ltd in modernizing asset management for Papua New Guinea Power using an integrated GIS system. A key learning was the immense value of centralizing day-to-day utility operations within a geospatial visual interface.

The new workflow incorporated a job card management module where all planned maintenance and emergency repairs were logged as tickets "job cards" with assets locations georeferenced on the map. Crews could visualize asset conditions, inventory availability, and infrastructure constraints relevant to the work site.

By completing digital forms during execution and closing out job cards upon completion, institutional knowledge was captured rather than lost. The GIS provided a holistic visual dashboard to track work status, optimize scheduling, and inform data-driven decision making.

Streamlining PNG Power Ltd's operations through GIS job coordination delivered transparency, accountability, and data continuity. Crews executed faster and smarter with geospatial visibility. Managers could report on key performance indicators. The utility maximized uptime and customer service.

This project exemplified why GIS should be core to any public infrastructure management. Utilities gain an invaluable advantage when geospatial logic pervades workflows. I'm proud to have helped PNG Power Ltd leverage GIS to work safer, smarter, and more efficiently across their national grid.
