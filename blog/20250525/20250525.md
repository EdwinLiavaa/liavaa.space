## Great News and Greater Clarity

This morning brought exciting news, my Bitcoin Games 2025 Hackathon project has been accepted, and I've earned a festival pass to the Bitcoin Conference 2025 in Las Vegas! After receiving a complimentary pass for my Bitcoin Games Hackathon project last year in 2024, I had vowed to attend this year's conference in person. The email arrived with all the details i.e. May 28-29 in Vegas, where the hackathon winners will be announced, $70,000 in prizes, and the promise of networking with top Bitcoin voices.

But sometimes the universe has a way of providing exactly what you need to hear at exactly the right moment.

## A Five Minute Moment That Changed Everything

Before checking my emails this morning, I took five minutes of silence, just me and my thoughts. It's become a small ritual, a moment to center myself before diving into the digital noise of notifications and demands. When I finally opened my inbox and saw the hackathon acceptance, my first instinct was excitement. Then came the practical calculations.

**Flight costs from Tonga via Nadi/Fiji to Dallas Fort Worth International (DFW), then to Vegas. Peak accommodation rates during the Bitcoin Conference 2025. The logistics, the expenses, the time away.**

But it wasn't really about the money.

## The Article That Hit Different

While processing the conference news, I stumbled upon an article on HackerNoon: ["You're Chasing the Wrong Definition of Wealth"](https://hackernoon.com/youre-chasing-the-wrong-definition-of-wealth). Sometimes you read something at exactly the moment you need to read it.

The piece challenged me to ask a fundamental question: **Do I really need to be there?**

The conference organizers themselves said it: *"You do not need to be in person to win, but we do recommend making it out!"* That qualifier, "but we do recommend", suddenly felt less like encouragement and more like societal pressure to chase experiences that might not align with my actual goals.

## Redefining Wealth and Success

The article's core message resonated deeply i.e. **"The best measure of wealth is what you have minus what you want, and by this measure some billionaires are broke."**

By that definition, I realized something profound, If that is the real measure of wealth, then I'm already a millionaire on that scale. My family's current earnings far outweigh what I actually want. My quest has always been aligned with **freedom rather than accumulation**, **financial sovereignty rather than millionaire status**.

This isn't about being unable to afford the trip. It's about recognizing that true wealth is having choices, it's about having the freedom to choose what matters most, rather than feeling compelled to chase every opportunity that presents itself, after all there will be another Bitcoin Conference 2026 and beyond.

## The Decision - Presence Over Physical Presence

After reviewing my balance sheet, my budget, and more importantly, my values, I've decided to postpone attending the Bitcoin Conference 2025 in person. Instead, I'll participate virtually, follow the hackathon results and winners announcement remotely.

This decision isn't about missing out, it's about showing up authentically. It's about recognizing that:

- **Remote engagement doesn't diminish the value of my hackathon contribution**
- **Being present mentally and creatively mattered more than physical presence during the hackathon**
- **True success is measured by alignment with your values, not adherence to expectations**
- **Financial sovereignty includes the wisdom to know when not to spend**

## The Real Victory

Sometimes the biggest wins come not from what we choose to pursue, but from what we choose to pass up. Today's decision feels like a victory,not over circumstances, but over the urge to conflate opportunity with obligation.

The Bitcoin Conference 2025 will be an incredible event, and I'm honored that be living it. But I'll be watching and following from the comfort of my own neck of woods.

After all, isn't that what Bitcoin itself represents? The freedom to transact, participate, and contribute on your own terms, without needing permission or presence in traditional spaces?

## Looking Forward

I'm excited to await the hackathon results and connect with fellow Bitcoin builders from around the world, regardless of the outcome. The global nature of Bitcoin means the most meaningful contributions often come from the most unexpected places, and sometimes that's a small island in the Pacific, contributing remotely but with full commitment to the vision of decentralized, sovereign money.

Here's to choosing freedom, financial sovereignty, and wealth measured not in miles traveled, but in values honored.
