"Beware of over-concern for money, or position, or glory. Someday you will meet a man who cares for none of these things. Then you will know how poor you are."

As a Pasifika wayfinder descended from the proud Polynesian voyagers, these words strike a profound chord. My ancestors understood something our modern human species has lost - that artificial constructs like currency, status, and ego are empty pursuits that stray from what truly matters.

We need look no further than the legend of the navigator [Liava'a](https://www.samoanews.com/linking-samoans/legend-atule), preserved in the oral histories of American Samoa, to be reminded of this wisdom. Curiously, though Liava'a's legacy is not mentioned in the Tongan oratory, the story endures among the Samoan people. When Liava'a sailed to find the pure waters of Fagasa Bay on Tutuila Island, his single-minded rage after accidentally leaving his daughter Sina ashore led him to disastrously cast his crew into the sea. Only through the transformative powers of nature were the men reborn as dolphins to herd fish and ensure Sina's survival. 

This story reveals how quickly we can lose our way when blinded by fear, anger and material pursuits. By forgetting our reverence for the natural world, we bring desolation upon ourselves and loved ones. Our Polynesian ancestors encoded these lessons to pass down an ethos of balance, humility, and reciprocity with our environment.

Somewhere along our collective journey, we chose to let man-made, unbalanced phenomena like currency dictate how we should orient our lives. And in doing so, we've sent ourselves adrift, separating from the natural rhythms, energies and universal truths that should be our guiding stars.

It's as if we've allowed our planetary canoe to slowly drift away from the warm, life-giving rays of the sun that sustain us. And by neglecting our role as stewards of this ocean-home, we've arrived at the precipice of potential extinction as a species.

The realization struck me clearly as I studied the sacred geometry of the Flower of Life - those ancient patterns that reveal the profound unity between all life-forms. What began as exploratory wisdom became a navigational metaphor:

We are the planet itself, disconnected from our cosmic source - those universal principles and natural laws that should orient our voyage. And if we continue along this arcing trajectory away from our cosmic and earthly orbits, we'll find ourselves adrift in darkness, cold and estranged from the primal spark that birthed us.

So how do we as an extended Pasifika family navigate our way back into the light? How do we correct course and steer ourselves not just towards survival, but towards a revitalized, purposeful thriving?

I don't claim to have all the answers. But I know this journey begins with each of us doing the inner work to shed those ego-driven pursuits of money, power and status. These are the empty callings that have disoriented us from what truly matters - our sovereign belonging in this universe, our role as caretakers of this ocean planet, and our fundamental kinship with all beings.

It requires a conscious return to humility, reverence and childlike awe for the primordial forces that birthed us. A remembering of how to live not just sustainably, but in reciprocal balance with our environment as our ancestors modeled. A rediscovery of our cosmic origins coded into the very spiral of our DNA.  

Once we've retuned ourselves to these ancient truths, we can chart a new course as a species - one disrupting the theoretical maps of domination, extraction and separation we've been following. One upending the self-destructive hierarchies we've imposed on ourselves and the natural world.

If this all resonates with a spiritual essence, it's because that is the very element we've been missing - that recognition of ourselves as spiritual beings attached to this lucid moment by sacred geometric energies. Frequencies we've lost connection to in our relentless, misguided pursuits of illusory "success."

So let this be a primal call to action for my fellow wayfinders and explorers of the cosmic ocean. A reminder that our planetary canoe drifts not by chance, but because we've forgotten how to read the stars, waves and winds that can reorient us.

The maps are ancient, etched in the very fabric of nature's womb from which we emerged. All that's needed is to humble ourselves, look inward, and begin paddling our way back to that radiant center that birthed us. 

Who's ready to weigh anchor and set sail towards the balance we've forsaken? The journey will be long, but our ancestors' celestial knowledge shows the way cannot be lost - only reawakened from the depths of our being. 

Let;s Go, way-finders!
