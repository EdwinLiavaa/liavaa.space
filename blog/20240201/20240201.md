The Office of the Regulator in Samoa recently issued a surprise order to immediately cease use of SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet services and equipment in the country. They claim Starlink poses risks to public safety and national security without providing evidence. This decision raises concerning questions.

Since when does a high-speed internet service like Starlink threaten safety and security? Starlink is already serving remote communities across 71 countries that lacked reliable internet access. There have been no reported incidents caused by Starlink to justify this allegation.

The notion that Starlink enables spying is also dubious. All internet services carry the potential for malicious actors to abuse them. Banning Starlink alone does not address that underlying issue. Proper cybersecurity measures would be a more reasonable approach.

Critics point out this order coincidentally follows the launch of Kacific broadband services in Samoa. As a major satellite broadband provider in the region, Kacific appears to benefit from less competition from innovative players like Starlink.

The regulator allows Kacific to operate while cracking down on Starlink? This raises questions of fair treatment and double standards at play.

Instead of an outright ban, the government should work with Starlink and other satellite providers to establish proper regulatory frameworks that encourage innovation and competition while addressing valid concerns. Access to affordable, high-speed broadband empowers people and strengthens economies in today's digital age. Halting progress through unjustified bans only holds us back.
