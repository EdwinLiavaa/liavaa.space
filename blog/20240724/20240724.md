I'm pleased to share that I've received my ticket to [bitcoin2024](https://b.tc/conference/2024): Festival Pass, scheduled for July 25-27, in Nashville, Tennessee, USA. While I won't be able to attend in person, I'm looking forward to the opportunity to participate online.

The conference boasts an impressive lineup of speakers from various fields. Notable figures include former President Donald Trump, who has expressed support for the American Bitcoin industry, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent presidential candidate. The event will also feature insights from established names in the cryptocurrency space such as Cathie Wood, Michael Saylor, and Edward Snowden.

Additionally, the conference will host speakers from diverse backgrounds. Russell Brand, known for his show "Stay Free with Russell Brand" on Rumble, will be presenting. Vivek Ramaswamy, a former Republican presidential candidate, is also scheduled to speak, will surely have some thought-provoking perspectives to share.

As a remote participant, I plan to engage with as much content as possible. This aligns well with my ongoing work on [PasifikaOS](https://github.com/EdwinLiavaa/pasifikaos), a Bitcoin-native operating system I'm developing.

Bitcoin 2024 promises to be a significant event for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. I anticipate that the discussions and announcements from this conference will play a role in shaping the future trajectory of this technology. Despite not being physically present, I'm eager to contribute to the broader conversation within the Bitcoin community.

I look forward to Bitcoin 2024 and the opportunity to learn from industry leaders and innovators. While I won't be there in person this time, I'm grateful for the chance to be part of this event virtually. Perhaps in the future, I'll have the opportunity to attend in person and connect with fellow enthusiasts face-to-face.
