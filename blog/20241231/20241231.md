As the sun sets on 2024, I find myself reflecting on a year that has been nothing short of transformative. This year has been a testament to the power of perseverance, innovation, and the unwavering belief in the potential of technology to transform lives. As we stand on the threshold of 2025, I am filled with gratitude for the milestones achieved and excitement for the possibilities that lie ahead.

The year 2024 has been a remarkable chapter in my professional journey, marked by significant achievements in the Web3 space. The HackerNoon community has become a second home, where my 33 stories have resonated with readers for over 13 days of collective reading time. Each article, from exploring Chainlink Solidity hybrid smart contracts to Vyper Python's integration with Rootstock Blockchain to delving into Hedera Hashgraph, has been a step toward bridging the gap between traditional technology and the blockchain frontier. The "Self Starter" badge awarded in December stands as a humble reminder of this journey.

Perhaps the most significant milestone of 2024 was the publication of my whitepaper, "Decentralized Micro-Governance Model for the Kingdom of Tonga Based on Proof-of-Work Consensus" in May. With 201 reads on ResearchGate and 214 reads on HackerNoon signifies growing academic interest, this research has laid the groundwork for reimagining governance in our beloved kingdom. It represents not just theoretical work, but a practical pathway to transforming how our citizens interact with government through blockchain technology.

Drawing from my experiences in both the Submarine Fiber Optic Cable and Satellite Broadband sectors, this year has reinforced my belief in the critical importance of digital infrastructure. The mission of "Leaving No One Behind Through Broadband Access" has never felt more urgent or achievable with the arrival of Starlink. My roles in skills development with USAID and as CTO of PowerPlay have shown me firsthand how technology can bridge gaps and create opportunities.

A particularly meaningful milestone in 2024 has been my decision to open-source decades of GIS innovation to the Pacific Islands community. Since 1997, I've dedicated myself to developing custom GIS solutions that have transformed how public utilities manage critical infrastructure across the Pacific Islands. The decision to publicly share over 45,000 lines of code and MapBasic modules represents more than just technical documentation â€“ it embodies my commitment to empowering developers across our region.

This contribution to the Pacific Islands FOSS4G (Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial) community reflects work spanning eight Pacific Island countries, encompassing everything from aerodrome data management to rainwater harvesting modeling, electric utility optimization, pearl farm site analysis, and telecom planning. As a GIS specialist and geospatial database developer, I've had the privilege of architecting integrated mapping systems that revolutionized asset management through data centralization, workflow automation, field mobility, and spatial analytics. Opening this knowledge to the community aligns perfectly with our vision for regional technological advancement and the principle of leaving no one behind.

As we bid farewell to 2024, there's a palpable sense of optimism in the air, particularly with the recent political changes in Tonga. The new government brings fresh perspective and energy to our collective vision of transformation. While my knowledge may be limited regarding the most recent political developments, the potential for positive change fills me with hope.

Looking ahead to 2025, my vision of transforming Tonga into the Web3 Tech Hub of the Pacific seems more achievable than ever. Drawing inspiration from the success stories of El Salvador, Bhutan, and the UAE, we can create our own unique path to technological advancement while preserving our rich cultural heritage. The concept of "Making Tonga Great Again" (MTGA) isn't just a slogan, it's a commitment to building a future where technology serves as a bridge to prosperity for all Tongans.

The year ahead holds immense promise for implementing the decentralized governance model, expanding our digital infrastructure, and nurturing local talent in blockchain technology. We envision a Tonga where blockchain seamlessly integrates into daily life, from secure digital identities to efficient government services, from modernized land registries to innovative energy management systems.

As we welcome 2025, we carry forward the lessons, achievements, and aspirations of 2024. Our journey toward Making Tonga Great Again is more than a technological transformation, it's about creating a sustainable, inclusive, and prosperous future that honors our past while embracing innovation. The pathway ahead requires dedication, unity, and unwavering commitment to our values.

To 2024, we say thank you for the lessons, the growth, and the opportunities. To 2025, we say welcome! We are ready to continue our journey toward making Tonga a beacon of Web3 innovation in the Pacific. Together, we can build a future where our children have access to world-class opportunities without leaving their homeland, where our businesses thrive in the digital economy, and where our government serves its people with unprecedented efficiency and transparency.

As we cross this threshold between years, let us carry forward the spirit of innovation, the strength of our cultural values, and the dream of a technologically advanced Tonga that leads the way in the Pacific. The journey of transformation continues, and with each step, we move closer to making our vision a reality.

Here's to 2024's achievements and to 2025's boundless possibilities. Together, we will make Tonga great again.
