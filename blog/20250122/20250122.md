As I announce my candidacy for the Tongan Parliament in the upcoming November elections, I am reminded of a profound shift we witnessed during the Trump Administration when tech titans like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai, and Tim Cook found themselves increasingly drawn into the political arena. Their journey mirrors the realization I've come to: "I am all in on building a better world powered by cryptography. My biggest challenge is resistance to change, and that's what drives my creative journey."

Let me be clear about my commitment: "I am dedicated to making Tonga the Web3 Tech Hub of the Pacific whereby, when I am not proposing and voting for Legislation in Parliament; I will be offering my 30+ years of experience "Free of Charge" as a personal Mentor, Teacher and Trainer to all citizens with or without any formal education qualifications to make something of themselves within the domains of Web3, Software Engineering, Prompt Engineering, Geomatics, Geospatial, GIS, Internet and Telecommunications. 

The intersection of technology and politics is no longer optional, it's imperative. During the Trump years, we saw tech leaders step beyond their corporate roles not by choice, but by necessity. They recognized what I now see clearly: the decisions that shape our digital future are not made in development labs or startup incubators, but in legislative chambers and policy meetings.

These tech visionaries didn't enter politics for power or prestige. They engaged because they understood that remaining on the sidelines meant watching crucial decisions about technology, innovation, and our digital future being made by those who might not fully grasp their implications. When discussions about data privacy, AI regulation, cryptocurrency, and digital infrastructure came to the forefront, their expertise wasn't just valuable, it was/is essential.

Their experience teaches us a crucial lesson: we cannot separate technological innovation from political reality. When Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress about social media's impact on society, or when Elon Musk engaged with governments about space exploration and electric vehicle policies, they weren't just defending their companies, they were advocating for informed, forward-thinking approaches to technological advancement.

This realization has profound implications for Tonga's future. As I prepare to run for Parliament, I'm not stepping away from my role as a tech advocate, I'm expanding it. My vision of making Tonga the Web3 Tech Hub of the Pacific isn't just a technological aspiration; it's a political imperative that requires legislative support and governmental understanding.

The role I envision goes beyond traditional political boundaries. When not in Parliament proposing and voting on legislation, I commit to serving as a mentor, teacher, and trainer to all Tongans, regardless of their formal education. Web3 technology offers unprecedented opportunities for economic empowerment and innovation, but only if we create the right regulatory framework and educational infrastructure to support it.

Consider the transformation we've already begun. Our work with decentralized governance models, the integration of blockchain technology, and the development of digital infrastructure has laid the groundwork. But to fully realize this potential, we need voices in Parliament who understand both the technological possibilities and the regulatory challenges.

The resistance to change I've encountered in promoting Web3 and blockchain solutions isn't just about technological skepticism, it's about institutional inertia. By taking a seat at the legislative table, we can address these challenges head-on, crafting policies that protect our citizens while fostering innovation.

This is why I'm committing to this new chapter in my journey. The time for tech advocates to merely advise from the sidelines has passed. Like those tech leaders who engaged with Washington during the Trump era, we must step into the arena where decisions are made. My campaign for Parliament isn't just about winning a seat, it's about ensuring that Tonga's future is shaped by those who understand the transformative power of technology.

The path forward requires us to bridge the gap between technological innovation and political reality. As I prepare to share my detailed campaign roadmap in the coming weeks, I'm reminded that this journey isn't just about personal ambition, it's about creating a future where technology serves all Tongans, where innovation is encouraged, and where our nation leads the Pacific in embracing the digital transformation.

To my fellow tech advocates and to all Tongans: the time for action is now. We can no longer afford to let critical decisions about our digital future be made without our direct involvement. Join me in this mission to transform Tonga into a beacon of technological innovation, where Web3 technology isn't just a buzzword, but a pathway to prosperity for all our citizens.

The future is not something that happens to us, it's something we create. Let's create it together, in the halls of Parliament and in the digital spaces where innovation thrives.

The journey continues...
