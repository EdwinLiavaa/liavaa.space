In my ongoing journey of personal transformation, I've encountered a fundamental truth about human potential that neuroscience has long confirmed: our capacity for change lies not just in our desires, but in our willpower, that remarkable force generated by our prefrontal cortex, the executive center of our brain.

Today, on this first Sunday of 2025, I found myself in an unexpected place, seated with my family in LDS Vaini Ward 3, participating in a worship service that stands in stark contrast to what many who know me might expect. The skeptical comments that followed my wife's Facebook post about our attendance revealed a truth about human perception, we often become imprisoned by others' expectations of who we are, or rather, who we once were.

What these well-meaning friends don't understand is that will-power isn't just about resistance, it's about growth. The prefrontal cortex, that remarkable region of our brain responsible for executive functions and decision-making, exhibits a fascinating characteristic, it strengthens through challenge. Like a muscle responding to resistance training, this vital area of our brain actually expands when we persistently engage in activities outside our comfort zone.

My journey from someone known for my fondness for alcohol to a person exploring different spiritual paths isn't about denying who I was, it's about embracing who I can become. The skepticism I've encountered serves as a powerful reminder of a lesson I've learned through experience, our capacity for change is limited only by our willingness to endure the discomfort of growth.

This willingness to embrace discomfort, what I call my "high tolerance for doing things I don't enjoy", isn't just a personal quirk. It's a scientifically backed pathway to neural development. Each time we choose to persist in an challenging activity, whether it's attending an unfamiliar religious service or maintaining sobriety, we're not just making a choice, we're literally rebuilding our brain's architecture.

In my previous reflection, I spoke about the necessity of self protection in a world where malevolence exists. Today, I realize that perhaps the greatest form of self protection is this very capacity for transformation, this ability to strengthen our prefrontal cortex through deliberate challenge. It's about protecting ourselves not just from external threats, but from the internal limitations we and others place upon ourselves.

To those who might question this path, who might see it as inconsistent with who they believe me to be, I offer this insight, true strength lies not in remaining static, but in having the courage to evolve. The same will-power that allows me to face uncomfortable situations has become my tool for crafting a new narrative, one that transcends past habits and embraces new possibilities.

As we progress through this new year, I challenge each of you to consider: What uncomfortable growth are you avoiding? What perceived limitations have you accepted as unchangeable truths? Remember, every time you persist in doing something challenging, you're not just changing your circumstances, you're literally rewiring your brain for greater resilience and capability.

The road continues to unfold before us, and with each step into discomfort, with each choice to persist despite the challenge, we're not just walking this path, we're building it, neuron by neuron, choice by choice, into a bridge toward our highest potential.

For in the end, willpower isn't just about resistance, it's about renaissance.

The Journey Continues...
