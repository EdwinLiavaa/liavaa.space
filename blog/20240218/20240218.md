For over 20+ years since 1997, I have developed custom GIS solutions to manage critical infrastructure and optimize operations for public utilities across the Pacific Islands. This GitHub repository is my contribution to the Pacific Islands Free and Open Source Software community by publicly open-sourcing over 45,000 lines of code and modules created with MapBasic for MapInfo to solve real-world challenges.

As a GIS specialist and geospatial database developer, I helped architect and design integrated mapping systems from the ground up for various island utilities including power, water, telecommunications, airports and disaster management agencies. These map-centric solutions revolutionized asset management through data centralization, workflow automation, field mobility, and spatial analytics.

Given the success of driving impact through technology across the Pacific, I believe open-sourcing code to navigate remote communities' unique challenges can empower other developers.

This repository organizes work spanning 8 Pacific Island countries across aerodrome data managemnt, rainwater harvesting modeling, electric utility optimization, pearl farm site analysis, and telecom planning.

I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or enhancements. Please reach out if you have any other use cases where these modules could provide a foundation. It's time to give back.

Let's leverage geospatial systems to build a better world together. ðŸ›
