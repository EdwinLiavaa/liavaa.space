This is inspired by a discussion I had a few moons ago with a colleague, a technologist, a renowned contributor in academia and the Pacific Islands Chapter of the Internet Society [PICISOC](https://picisoc.org) community. [William (Will) Tibben (PhD)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-will-tibben-phd-5851bb12), I am now putting my Philosopher hat onðŸŽ“. 

The open source movement is powered by a communal spirit of openness, sharing, and collaboration. This has led to incredible software advancements that benefit society. However, some subtle misalignments of interests threaten to undermine these ideals.

Those who extensively utilize open source software in their products have benefited tremendously from the unpaid contributions of others. While most contribute back in some way, some may not be doing their fair share. If one's business is built on open source code, they incur a moral duty to also be active contributors.

Of course, meaningful contributions take considerable time and resources. We must be understanding of the business constraints companies face. But individuals who position themselves as "advocates" of open source should lead by example. My definition of an open source advocate is someone I find releasing code on GitHub or writing documentation and tutorials to help others. Lets gently ask ourselves - are we walking the walk in sharing our own code and knowledge with others? 

Rather than accusations, we should have a thoughtful discussion on how to better align interests. How can we make it easier for all who build on open source to also give back? This will look different for large and small companies. But more open dialog and sharing of best practices could help.

The open source ecosystem is incredibly complex. There are no perfect solutions. But by calmly examining where interests diverge, we can nudge things in a fairer direction. This will help open source continue thriving.

The goal is not to call out any individual or company. It is to remind ourselves of open source's communal roots. If we each contribute according to our means, the movement will grow in a sustainable way.
