In my previous blog post from July 1st, I explored the vulnerability of Tonga's domestic submarine cable infrastructure and proposed that satellite broadband technology could offer a more resilient and adaptive connectivity solution for the island nation. Regrettably, events have once again proven the prescience of that assessment.

As reported on [Matangi Tonga](https://matangitonga.to) yesterday, Tonga's domestic fiber-optic submarine cable suffered yet another outage following a series of strong earthquakes, including a 6.8 magnitude quake centered in the Ha'apai group. This marks the fourth such incident in just the past five years, from 2019 to 2024. Calculating the probability of these cable severance events to date reveals a concerning trend - an 80% likelihood of the same occurrence happening again.

The persistent nature of these disruptions underscores the inherent challenges of maintaining reliable submarine cable infrastructure in Tonga's seismically and volcanically active maritime environment. Despite the significant investments made to repair these breaks, the pattern of failure shows no sign of abating.

In light of this latest development, I've said it before, I'm saying it again, it is time to definitively conclude that satellite broadband presents the optimal connectivity solution for Tonga, both as a primary backbone for individual households and as a resilient backup to the existing submarine cable network. Satellite internet technology has advanced rapidly in recent years, offering vastly improved performance and affordability. Crucially, it is not susceptible to the same environmental risks that plague submarine cables in this region.

Moreover, satellite broadband can provide comprehensive coverage across Tonga's widespread archipelago, ensuring that even the most remote communities in Vava'u, Ha'apai, 'Eua and the Niuas have access to reliable internet connectivity. This aligns with the country's efforts to bridge the digital divide and drive digital transformation.

In conclusion, the recurrence of cable outages in Tonga, with now an 80% probability of future incidents, clearly demonstrates the need for a paradigm shift in the island nation's connectivity strategy. Satellite broadband, such as Starlink, emerges as the optimal solution, offering a resilient primary network and a dependable backup to the existing submarine infrastructure. As Tonga navigates the challenges of maintaining its digital lifeline, embracing satellite technology is the prudent path forward to ensure a robust and sustainable communications landscape for the island kingdom.

This will be my final piece on Tonga's connectivity saga, as I believe the case for satellite-based solutions has been firmly established. I look forward to following the progress of Tonga's digital transformation in the years to come.
