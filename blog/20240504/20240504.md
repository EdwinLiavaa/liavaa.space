It has been some time since I last wrote, as I have been engaged in an ADB Renewable Energy Development Project for disaster risk resilience consulting work. This critical initiative aims to develop policies and frameworks for identifying infrastructure exposure and vulnerability to natural hazards for electric utilities in the Federated States of Micronesia. 

Through GIS mapping and risk assessments, we are analyzing asset damage likelihoods from disasters to prioritize resilience investments. A key aspect is providing capacity building to stakeholders on methodologies for ongoing disaster vulnerability analysis and risk monitoring.

As I prepare to present on this work at the upcoming FOSS4G Oceania in Hobart and Pacific GIS/RS conferences, I find myself reflecting on the transformative power of Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial applications (FOSS4G). The proprietary vendor's warning from years ago - "be very careful" - seems almost comical now given how FOSS4G has become integral to my geospatial practice.

The gospel of FOSS4G that I have been spreading centers around QGIS - the free, open source geographic information system that has been a game-changer for democratizing access to robust GIS capabilities. On the disaster risk resilience project, QGIS and its mobile data collection companion QField have proven invaluable tools for navigating the complex landscape of utilities asset management.

With QGIS, we are able to conduct comprehensive geospatial analysis to map critical infrastructure assets like power plants, transmission lines, and distribution networks. Layering in hazard data allows modeling of potential impacts from cyclones, flooding, sea level rise, fire hazards, earthquakes and other threats. The software's intuitive interface and depth of functionality enables efficient workflows from data preparation through to visualization and report generation.

QField takes the power of QGIS into the field on mobile devices for streamlined asset surveying and data collection. Utility field teams can easily capture asset locations and attributes with offline editing capabilities ensuring reliable data even in remote areas. Seamless data synchronization between QField and QGIS provides a continuous cycle of intelligence gathering and analysis.

Beyond just technical capabilities, embracing QGIS and QField aligns with the deeper principles I believe in as a FOSS4G advocate. These open source tools put the ownership and direction in the hands of global communities rather than corporations. Their transparency and lack of restrictive licensing allows true democratization of access.

In the Pacific Island context, FOSS4G presents an empowering path forward for building local technical capacity without being trapped in proprietary software monopolies and punitive costs. Communities can take full ownership of their geospatial data resources using tools built on principles of openness and collaboration across borders.

As a Pasifika wayfinder helping to navigate the course for climate-resilient development, I see QGIS and QField as vital navigational aids to chart pathways through complex challenges like climate change impacts, disaster vulnerability, natural resource management and more. The open source philosophy ensures these powerful tools can be leveraged by all.

My journey with FOSS4G, which began with trepidation years ago, has become one of continual growth and empowerment. I am excited to keep advancing its adoption through training, software contributions and project implementations demonstrating the immense value of these open technologies.

The world needs more advocates promoting FOSS4G as a vehicle for positive change. With tools like QGIS and QField in hand, we can navigate towards a future of resilient communities with an equitable path forward illuminated by open collaboration.
