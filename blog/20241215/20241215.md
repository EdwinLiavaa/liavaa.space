Yesterday, I had the opportunity to help install a Starlink Mini, and the experience brought to light the evolving landscape of internet connectivity in the Pacific Islands. As we navigate the ongoing debate between submarine fiber optic cables and satellite solutions like Starlink, it’s essential to consider how these investments align with the unique challenges of our scattered populations and the pressing need for reliable internet access.

Many Pacific Island nations have heavily invested in submarine fiber optic cables, believing that these connections would serve as the backbone for modern digital infrastructure. The Tuvalu VAKA Cable, which links Funafuti to the broader Pacific network, marks a significant step toward enhancing connectivity. However, despite these advancements, many residents still rely on outdated technologies like ADSL and 4G, which struggle to deliver on the promises of high-speed internet.

The small populations of Pacific Island nations, spread across vast distances, create high per capita costs for maintaining and operating these expensive submarine cable infrastructures. For many, the reality of internet service remains disappointing. Unlimited plans offered by some providers depend on aging copper networks, severely limiting speeds and making it difficult to fully realize the benefits of high-capacity submarine cables.

Moreover, submarine cables are particularly susceptible to disruptions from cable cuts, which can result from natural disasters, fishing activities, or seismic events. For instance, Tonga has experienced multiple outages related to its submarine cable infrastructure, with a concerning probability of 80% for such incidents to recur in the future. This vulnerability highlights a significant risk associated with relying solely on submarine cables for connectivity, as repeated disruptions can leave entire communities without access to the internet for extended periods.

In contrast, satellite solutions like Starlink present a more adaptable alternative. With advancements like the Starlink Mini, users can access internet speeds of up to 150 Mbps for just TOP 201 a month. This solution is not only cost-effective but also portable, allowing for connectivity from various locations across the Pacific Islands.

The crux of the issue lies in the "last mile." While submarine cables can transmit data at terabits per second, the final delivery to consumers often hinges on legacy systems that cannot keep pace with these capabilities. The speed of light in fiber optics starkly contrasts with the slower speeds of copper-based technologies. This fundamental disconnect raises critical questions: What is the point of investing in costly submarine cables if the last mile still drags behind in performance?

As I installed the Starlink Mini, I was struck by the potential of satellite technology in our region. With the ability to connect to high-speed internet from virtually anywhere, Starlink serves as a viable alternative to traditional infrastructure. This flexibility to access reliable internet at a fraction of the cost of maintaining extensive submarine systems is particularly appealing for the Pacific Islands, where connectivity is crucial for education, business, and emergency services.

As we evaluate the future of connectivity in the Pacific Islands, it’s clear that a one-size-fits-all approach may not be suitable. While submarine fiber optic cables are essential for improving regional connectivity, they must be complemented by innovative solutions like Starlink to ensure that all residents benefit from reliable internet access. The ongoing investments in submarine infrastructure should not overshadow the potential of satellite technologies, especially in regions with unique geographic challenges.

By embracing a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both submarine cables and satellite solutions, we can work towards a more connected and digitally inclusive future for the Pacific Islands. The goal should be to ensure that all citizens can access the internet, not just those fortunate enough to live near cable landing points. In our quest for connectivity, let’s prioritize practicality and accessibility, ensuring that every resident can truly benefit from the digital age.
