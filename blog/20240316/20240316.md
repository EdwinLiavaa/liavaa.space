Back in the late 1990s, I was first exposed to the liberating philosophy of "free as in freedom" and open source software (FOSS). As an early tech innovator, the idea of community-driven software development resonated deeply with my values of collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and democratizing access.

However, my full [FOSS4G](https://foss4g.org/) (Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial) awakening didn't occur until 2008 during my work on the [Pacific Hydrological Cycle Observing System (HYCOS)](https://hydrohub.wmo.int/en/projects/Pacific-HYCOS) project. This multi-year initiative aimed to improve freshwater resource monitoring and management across Pacific Island nations.

As I researched the most suitable technologies, I discovered the powerful capabilities of [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) - a free, open source geographic information system (GIS). Initially, I'll admit I had some trepidation about going all-in on open source for such a critical project. The proprietary vendors' warnings echoed in my mind, like when one sales rep ominously warned "You should be very careful" after my presentation on HYCOS Updates using QGIS during the Pacific GIS/RS conference 2008.

My defiant response at the time still rings true: "I am not scared of anything or anyone." I decided to have courage in my convictions about FOSS.

Implementing QGIS for data visualization, analysis, and modeling proved to be a resounding success for Pacific HYCOS. We could provide robust GIS capabilities to partners across 14 countries in a cost-effective, sustainable way using open source software.

From that pivotal experience, I became an avid open source evangelist in the geospatial realm. The intuitive design, frequent updates, and vast array of functionalities in QGIS impressed me. Most importantly, the philosophy of community ownership, rather than corporate monopolies, aligned with my beliefs about democratizing access to vital technologies.

In the decade-plus since, the evolution of QGIS and the broader FOSS4G landscape has been remarkable. What began as a niche, underdog movement is now a driving force across major industries, government agencies, academic institutions, and nonprofits worldwide. 

The QGIS project has flourished with an incredibly passionate global community of developers, contributors, and advocates continuously enhancing the software. Plugin repositories and training resources have expanded its usability across diverse domains like hydrology, conservation, urban planning, and more.

As for me, I've become an independent GIS consultant specializing in FOSS4G solutions full-time. Every client project I take on now leverages the powerful capabilities of tools like QGIS, PostGIS, GRASS GIS and other open source geospatial software. I derive immense professional satisfaction from delivering robust solutions while adhering to FOSS principles.

My FOSS4G journey has been one of continual learning, growth, and empowerment. I've gone from a place of uncertainty about relying on open source years ago, to now being able to fully endorse these technologies without reservation based on demonstrated impact.

The open source philosophy is about creating a more equitable world where access to transformative tools is democratized. By leveraging the collective wisdom of global communities, innovative solutions can flourish transparently.

Looking ahead, I'm excited to see QGIS and other FOSS4G tools have an increasingly vital role in solving humanity's great challenges like climate change, natural resource management, disease tracking, urban resilience, disaster and vulnerability assessment. The open source model ensures frictionless collaboration among experts across borders.

My role is to keep advocating for and advancing FOSS4G through software contributions, training, and project implementations. The world needs more advocates promoting open source as a vehicle for positive change. I'm proud to be part of this continuously evolving movement shaping a better future.
