This is a great piece from a current PhD Student(you can find it [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/julianachanphd_findyoursuperpower-inspiration-worldmentalhealthday-activity-7249939708426797057-htk0)), and I quote: 

"If you are a people pleaser, read this! I suggest you stop right now.

Here's what I see young people doing:
- working in soulless jobs to appear successful
- staying small & quiet to avoid offending others
- studying for a degree their parents pick for them

I know someone who changed their college degree because their parents said it was a "safer" career. Why pick boring and safe at 18? Do that when you're 80!

On World Mental Health Day (10 October), I think it is time that we start living life on our own terms. Here's where we can start:

1. Set boundaries
No is a full sentence. We don't always need to make others feel comfortable at our expense. We don't need to explain our choices to satisfy them. Say no.

1. Take advice only from people we admire and trust
The problem is that many of us listen to our haters and critics.... people who never loved us anyway. If we won't take advice from them, why take criticism from them? Send them a mirror instead.

1. Focus on our North Star
Social media can be a noisy place, and people look more successful online than they really are. Don't watch someone's highlight reel and assume everything is rosy for them. Stay focused.

You do you. I do me. Agree?

PS: Are you pleasing people or living your dream life? ðŸ’¡

This resonates deeply with me. It's a powerful reminder that we often sacrifice our own happiness and dreams to please others or meet societal expectations. On this World Mental Health Day, let's reflect on how we can prioritize our own well being and aspirations.

What do you think? Have you ever found yourself people-pleasing at the expense of your own goals? How do you maintain a balance between considering others and staying true to yourself?
