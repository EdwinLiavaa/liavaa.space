The internet has undergone profound changes since its early days as a decentralized academic network. As usage grew, the mainstream web evolved to meet new user needs and market realities. While some lament the loss of the early internet's open ethos, we can view its transitions as a natural market-driven progression. The key is to learn from the past and join in steering the internet's next evolution towards an equitable future.

The transition from Web1 to Web2 brought us convenient mobile apps, social networks, and new business models. However, concerns emerged around centralization of power, data privacy and lack of interoperability. Dissatisfaction with these downsides has fueled interest in a renewed vision for the internet's evolution into Web3.

Built on the distributed ledger technology domain, Web3 aims to redistribute control with ownership to users through decentralization and cryptographic systems like Blockchains. Early applications are exploring novel approaches to digital assets, identities, storage, and finance. The goal is user agency via means like cryptocurrency and decentralized protocols. Rather than blaming past trajectories, we can constructively apply new innovations to rebalance equity on the internet.

Work remains to enhance accessibility, scale these technologies responsibly, and build viable business models. We also need inclusive governance models and smart regulation to steward development in the public interest. But its potential to restore the internet's early spirit of openness and empowerment is promising.

The internet will continue evolving with or without our guidance nor participation. But, by joining in shaping the evolution of the web wisely and humanely, we can drive change to benefit all. Our collective choices today will write the future history of the internet and its role in society. Instead of just inheriting the internet, we can and must take part in crafting its next chapter. 

Let's Build! ðŸ›
