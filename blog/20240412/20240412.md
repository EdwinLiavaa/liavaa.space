As I reflect back on my journey from the corporate world to this newfound life of digital advocacy and hands-on engineering, I can't help but feel a renewed sense of exhilaration. The freedom to dive deep into technical challenges, experiment with solutions, and ultimately deliver tangible results for the communities I serve has rekindled a passion that lay dormant during my executive years.

Just this morning, I found myself engrossed in troubleshooting a printer driver issue on a Linux system. The EPSON TM-T82III had been giving my friend's small business endless headaches, and after struggling with it for the better part of a day and night, I finally managed to crack the code this morning.

The sense of accomplishment I felt in that moment was akin to the rush I used to experience in my younger days as a technical statistician and software technician. There's just something deeply rewarding about diving into a complex problem, trying out different approaches, and ultimately arriving at a fix that makes a real difference in people's lives.

I often find myself reminiscing about those earlier chapters of my career, where I'd spend hours poring over code, tinkering with hardware, and relentlessly pursuing solutions. It was a level of hands-on engagement and problem-solving that I had gradually lost touch with as I ascended the corporate ladder.

But now, in this next phase of my life, I've reclaimed that joy of engineering during my retirement. Whether it's installing Starlink networks, migrating computers to Linux, building websites, mentoring, blogging or resolving stubborn printer issues, I approach each challenge with the same fervor and curiosity that defined my formative years in the tech industry.

And the best part? I get to share these moments of triumph with the very people I'm empowering. Seeing the relief and gratitude on the faces of the small business owners, students, and community members I work with is far more fulfilling than any corner office or executive bonus could ever be.

In a way, this return to my technical roots has reminded me of the true purpose that has always driven me – using my skills and knowledge to make a tangible, positive impact on the lives of others. It's not about titles or accolades, but about the simple satisfaction of solving problems and equipping people with the tools they need to thrive.

As I continue on this path of digital advocacy and grassroots engineering, I know there will be many more challenges to overcome, puzzles to solve, and systems to fix. But that's precisely what energizes me. The thrill of the technical fix, the rush of finding a solution, and the joy of empowering communities – this is what makes my heart sing.

So while my days as a corporate executive may be behind me, I've never felt more alive and fulfilled. I'm back in my element, doing what I love, and making a real difference in the lives of those who need it most. And that, to me, is the ultimate reward.
