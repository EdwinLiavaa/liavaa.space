In a recent announcement, Tonga Power Limited (TPL) unveiled an ambitious $3.8 million pa'anga plan to "improve" Tonga's electricity network this year. The initiative, in collaboration with New Zealand's Northpower, aims to stabilize power supply, upgrade infrastructure, and develop a long-term network plan. On the surface, this might seem like a step in the right direction. However, a deeper look reveals a troubling reality: TPL is asking Tongan consumers to foot the bill for rectifying its own systemic failures, all while clinging to an obsolete centralized utility model.

Let's start with the elephant in the room - TPL's Arial Bundles Cabled (ABC) System. Why doesn't TPL just come clean and admit that this system has been a total fiasco? Drive along any road in Tonga, and you'll see a forest of power poles, not for the benefit of consumers, but as a testament to a misguided strategy that has primarily fattened the coffers of a supposedly New Zealand company [Ngati Tahu Ngati Whaoa Runaga Ltd](https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/311270/tonga-comfortable-with-maori-trust-agreement) but it is registered in Vanuatu. The proliferation of these poles was supposed to enhance grid resilience and reliability. Instead, it has become a stark visual reminder of TPL's missteps, cluttering our landscapes without delivering the promised benefits.

Now, in a move that can only be described as adding insult to injury, TPL plans to rectify these mistakes using funds extracted from the very consumers who have been suffering the consequences. Where is the $3.8 million pa'anga for this "improvement" coming from? Is there a grant or loan? Is it from TPL's corporate reserves or as compensation from the contractors who implemented the flawed ABC system? If No then, it's coming straight from the pockets of Tongan taxpayers - the same people who have endured frequent power outages, high electricity bills, and a landscape marred by ineffective infrastructure.

But the most egregious aspect of this plan isn't just its financial source; it's the glaring lack of vision. TPL's announcement reads like a technical checklist: stabilize supply, upgrade components, strengthen infrastructure. These are band-aid solutions, attempting to patch up a fundamentally broken model without any forward-thinking design for Tonga's energy future.

Where is the vision for transitioning to renewable energy? Where are the plans for decentralized microgrids that could provide resilience against outages and natural disasters? Where is the strategy to empower communities as energy prosumers, allowing them to generate, consume, and trade their own renewable power? The answer is nowhere. TPL remains stubbornly anchored to an obsolete top-down utility model, throwing good money after bad to maintain a centralized system that has repeatedly proven its inadequacies.

Contrast this with the decentralized blockchain-based governance and energy model I've been advocating. This isn't just a technological upgrade; it's a philosophical renaissance in how we conceive and manage our critical infrastructure. By re-architecting Tonga's entire governance around blockchains and proof-of-work consensus, we create a framework where energy policies emerge directly from the participatory efforts of citizens. No longer are decisions made in boardrooms by distant executives; instead, they crystallize through the transparent, quantifiable work of community members.

In this model, every Tongan household becomes a potential node in an interconnected web of smart microgrids. Using distributed renewable sources like solar, wind, and ocean energy, communities generate their own power. Through blockchain's immutable ledgers and smart contracts, they can securely trade surplus energy in real-time peer-to-peer markets. High-bandwidth, low-latency Starlink internet ensures even our most remote islands are seamlessly integrated into this decentralized energy democracy.

When outages occur in one area, the grid automatically reroutes power from neighboring microgrids, making the entire system more resilient. Data analytics and machine learning optimize these energy flows, ensuring stability and efficiency. Most importantly, the policies governing this system - from infrastructure deployments to resource rights - are not dictated from above but emerge organically through community members' proof-of-work contributions.

TPL's $3.8 million "upgrade" plan exemplifies the dying gasps of an outdated paradigm. It seeks to prop up a fragile centralized grid by extracting more from already burdened consumers, without any transformative vision. Meanwhile, our proposed model offers a regenerative path forward - one where every Tongan becomes an active participant in co-creating a resilient, sustainable, and democratically governed energy future.

The technology is ready. The cultural ethos aligns with our ancestral values of unity through diversity. What's missing is the courage to break free from obsolescent institutional inertia. TPL's latest initiative isn't just a financial misstep; it's a missed opportunity to pivot towards a truly decentralized, community-driven energy renaissance.

As Tongans, we stand at a crossroads. We can continue subsidizing the mistakes of a failing centralized system, or we can embrace our heritage as wayfinders, charting a bold course into a future where our energy infrastructure reflects our values of participatory harmony and self-determination. The choice is clear. The power to transform our energy landscape lies not in the boardrooms of utilities, but in the hands of every Tongan citizen. Let's reclaim it.
