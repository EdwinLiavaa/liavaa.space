For those who have been following my journey, you know that I'm deeply committed to the world of web3, blockchain, and cryptocurrency. This passion, however, isn't just driven by techno-futurism - it's intricately woven into my personal philosophy and approach to life itself.

You see, from an early age, I recognized that the conventional path to financial security wasn't going to cut it for me. The 9-to-5 grind, piling up debt for an overpriced home, and spending the bulk of your income on a crippling cost of living? No, thank you. I wanted more for myself and my family.

It was not until the Covid pandemic restrictions that I discovered and embraced what I call the "life hack formula" : Retire early from full-time work + transition to remote work with above an average remuneration package + move to low cost of living area = financial independence/freedom.

It's important to note that when I refer to financial freedom, I'm not referring to accumulation of wealth and riches. Rather, it's the freedom and contentment that comes from living without the stresses of the 9-5 corporate/public service bureaucracy and being able to achieve a comfortable life on your own terms financially.

Embracing this formula has given me a vastly improved work-life balance. No more overly regimented schedules or endless commutes. Instead, I'm able to structure my days to allocate quality time for family, personal interests, and passion projects. Unexpectedly, it's also allowed me to discover my deep love for writing as a blogger - a creative outlet I never knew I possessed until I had the temporal freedom to explore it.

It was this formula that guided my decision to ultimately leave Australia after a 3-year stint with my family. As I approached my 50s, I realized that permanently migrating there would mean locking myself into an exorbitant cost of living that would counteract any financial gains.

Instead, I returned to my roots in the Pacific Islands and the Wayfinders' way of life - mortgage-free living, self-subsistence practices, and an incredibly low cost of living while still commanding an above-average remote tech remuneration package. 

But it was my deep dive into web3 that took this "life hack" to new heights. You see, the core pillars of blockchain technology - decentralization, transparency, self-sovereignty - mesh perfectly with the philosophies that underpin my personal and financial liberation.

Through blockchain, we can divest from centralized systems that have long extracted value from our communities. We can tokenize and fractionalize ownership of assets, fostering models of community investment and equitable value distribution. We can participate in decentralized finance protocols that democratize access to banking services without predatory terms.

Moreover, the skills I've honed in this emerging domain - securing digital sovereignty through self-custodial wallets, navigating decentralized apps and DAO governance, astute managing of crypto portfolios - have become invaluable assets that can generate alternative income streams for my family.

So as I forge ahead on this Web3 journey, I do so with a clarity of purpose that blockchain represents the greatest "life hack" of all. It's a frontier that empowers us to rewrite the rules of financial autonomy and self-determination based on revolutionary principles.

No longer are we beholden to centralized gatekeepers and their rigged systems of socioeconomic control. The future belongs to those who embrace decentralization as a life ethos - a neo-wayfinding paradigm for charting courses to true personal and collective prosperity through freedom, not wealth.

Equipped with the time-tested wisdom of my Pasifika ancestors and the innovative technologies of this blockchain renaissance, I've set forth to not just find freedom...but to create an entirely new definition of it.

The revolution will be decentralized. Who's navigating this new world with me?
