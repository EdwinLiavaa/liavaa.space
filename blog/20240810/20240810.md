It's been a while since my last Blog post on the 31 July 2024. Although I write a lot about Bitcoin, Blockchain and Satellite Broadband Connectivity, my passion for making beautiful maps is still my bread and butter. As a GIS practitioner for over 20+ years, I have always been passionate about helping others by deriving analysis on scenarios that most people do not think about, of which I am sharing with you.

Yesterday, I had the privilege of presenting my vision for a decentralized  developmental digital micro future powered by renewable energy and blockchain-based governance at the Tonga Youth ICT Symposium. The event, hosted by the Tonga Women in ICT ([TWICT](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100083222176057)), brought together some of the brightest young minds from across our island nation to explore the transformative potential of emerging technologies.

During my presentation, I shared the results of a simple calculation I had conducted, which highlighted the immense untapped renewable energy potential of Tonga. As detailed in my presentation ([here](https://github.com/EdwinLiavaa/TWICT-Youth-ICT-Symposium)), our nation's total usable roof space could accommodate over 3.6 million solar panels, generating a staggering 2.6 billion kWh of clean electricity annually. This is over 37 times greater than Tonga's electricity net consumption of just 70 million kWh in 2022 ([World Data Atlas In 2022](https://knoema.com/atlas/Tonga/topics/Energy/Electricity/Electricity-net-consumption)).

Yet, as I looked around the room, I couldn't help but wonder: why haven't our government's renewable energy specialists and the team at Tonga Power Ltd already seized upon this opportunity? After all, the Tonga Renewable Energy Roadmap, launched with much fanfare a few years ago, promised to transform our energy landscape. But all too often, these grand initiatives have benefited only a select vendors and contractors, with little tangible impact on the lives of everyday Tongans.

This is where the power of a decentralized digital micro future becomes so crucial. By empowering our youth to take ownership of their energy systems through blockchain-enabled micro-grids, we can bypass the bureaucracy and vested interests that have long stifled progress. Imagine a world where every community has the ability to generate, store, and trade their own renewable energy, all while using blockchain-based smart contracts to ensure transparency and equitable distribution.

This is the future I laid out for the young leaders gathered at the ICT Symposium – a future where Tonga's abundant natural resources are harnessed not for the benefit of a privileged few, but for the collective prosperity of our entire nation. By embracing technologies like solar power, battery storage, and blockchain, we can create resilient, self-sustaining micro-societies that are resilient to the whims of centralized systems and distant policymakers.

The response from the audience was nothing short of electrifying. Young Tongans from all walks of life – engineers, entrepreneurs, community organizers – shared my sense of excitement and determination to turn this vision into reality. They recognized that the path to true self-determination lies not in waiting for the government to act, but in taking matters into our own hands.

As I left the Symposium, I couldn't help but feel a renewed sense of optimism for Tonga's future. Our nation's youth are ready to lead the charge towards a decentralized digital micro future, one powered by renewable energy, blockchain-based governance, and a deep sense of shared ownership and responsibility. The time for action is now, and I'm confident that together, we can build a Tonga that is truly resilient, equitable, and responsive to the needs of all its citizens.
