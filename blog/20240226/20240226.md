In 2011, I worked on an impactful project to build a geographic information system (GIS) to help provide sustainable management of pearl farms in Manihiki Atoll, Cook Islands. As the country's most valuable export industry at the time, worth over NZ$12 million annually, ensuring the ecological sustainability of Cook Islands pearl farming was critical.

The project was a collaboration between the Ministry of Marine Resources (MMR), Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), and Manihiki pearl farmers. My role was to develop the GIS technology and workflow to enable robust census data collection, mapping of farm boundaries, and ongoing monitoring. This included capturing GPS coordinates of each farm's boundary ropes, digitizing lines to delineate leases, and performing spatial analysis to allocate boundaries equitably.

The resulting GIS delivered transparency into leasing arrangements, prevented overcrowding and disease, and enabled precise record-keeping. By surveying both the farm lines and individual farmers, the system centralized key information for better decision making. The easy-to-use interface and visualizations built trust and engagement across stakeholders.

Implementing this pearl farm management GIS exemplified the power of geospatial technology to balance economic livelihoods and ecological sustainability even in remote island environments. The solution improved governance and empowered communities to become stewards of their precious marine resources for generations to come. It was an honor to leverage my expertise to drive impact for the Cook Islands.
