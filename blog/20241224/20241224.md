As I sit here anticipating Christmas Eve, wrapping up two project proposals that consumed my entire weekend responding to comments from an evaluator, I've reached an unexpected moment of clarity in my career. Throughout my journey from hands-on engineering roles to executive positions as CEO of Tonga Cable Ltd, CTO at PowerPlay, Corporate and Regional Director at Kacific Broadband Satellites. I've always found my comfort zone in the engine room, deep in the technical trenches where logic and precision reign supreme.

My engineering DNA, forged through decades of work across diverse domains from geospatial systems to blockchain technology, from submarine fiber optic cables to satellite communications has always favored efficiency: bullet points, clear metrics, and concise technical summaries. It's a language that resonates perfectly with fellow engineers in my domain, whether we're discussing disaster risk reduction policies for utilities in Micronesia or developing smart contracts on Ethereum, EVM Chains, Hedera and Rootstock.

However, my recent experience in consultancy has brought an interesting challenge to light. As someone who has led digital transformation initiatives across the Pacific, from expanding broadband coverage to championing Web3 technologies, I've found myself increasingly adapting my communication style to meet the expectations of evaluators who prefer their technical content served with a generous helping of narrative prose, what I playfully call "sugar coating."

This weekend's proposal marathon has been particularly enlightening. As I transformed technical specifications into flowing narratives, I realized something crucial: perhaps it's time for me to evolve once again. Not away from engineering, but rather up the stack, where I can serve as a bridge between the engine room and the boardroom. After all, isn't this what I've been unconsciously doing throughout my career, whether it was making satellite communications accessible across the Pacific, developing GIS solutions for 14 Pacific Island nations, or leading blockchain awareness initiatives.

The younger generation of engineers shouldn't have to spend countless hours converting their precise, technical thinking into elaborate prose just to get their brilliant ideas across. They should be free to focus on what they do best, innovating and solving complex technical challenges. Whether they're working on smart contract security, developing geospatial databases, or expanding digital connectivity, their time is better spent pushing technological boundaries than wrestling with report aesthetics.

This realization aligns perfectly with my ongoing work in digital skills development and capacity building across the Pacific. As someone who has consistently worked to bridge digital divides and remove barriers to technology adoption, perhaps this is my next calling, to be the translator, the facilitator who can help streamline this process. Having been both in the engine room and the boardroom, understanding both languages fluently, I can create more value by helping these talented engineers navigate the sometimes Byzantine world of corporate communication.

As I serenade Christmas tunes after submitting these proposals, I'm energized by this new perspective. My journey from a humble beginnings of a computer operator at the Tonga Electric Power Board to leading major digital infrastructure projects has taught me that sometimes the most valuable revelations come not from the work itself, but from reflecting on how we do that work and why. It's time to leverage this experience to create pathways for the next generation of Pacific engineers, ensuring their brilliant technical solutions don't get lost in translation.

Wishing you all a Merry Christmas and a Prosperous New Year! The journey continues...
