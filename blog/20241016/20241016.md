Hey everyone! Today, I want to dive deeper into a topic that’s been buzzing around the financial world, "Inflation vs Bitcoin". You might remember my last piece where I touched on how El Salvador is shaking things up by adopting Bitcoin as legal tender. But today, I want to blend some ideas from Milton Friedman and Jonathan Nitzan to shed light on what’s really driving inflation and why I think Bitcoin could be part of the solution.

First off, let’s talk about Milton Friedman. He famously argued that inflation is “always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.” Essentially, he believed that when too much money is printed, prices rise. It’s a straightforward theory that many people still buy into today. On the other hand, we have Jonathan Nitzan, who brings a fresh perspective, suggesting that inflation isn’t just about money supply, it’s about how that money circulates and affects different sectors of the economy, creating winners and losers.

Now, here’s where I stand, I see merit in both arguments. Yes, Friedman points out a crucial factor dictated by the money supply. But Nitzan reminds us that the real world impact of inflation is uneven, and this is where things get interesting.

So, what’s the deal here? Is there a real culprit behind inflation? Yes! to me, it is something deeper, rooted within the illusion that inflation is fixable using the same principles of the experiment that caused it to happen in the first place. Does it ring a bell? "Insanity is repeating the same mistakes and expecting different results.” We have witnessed throughout history that inflation is like a recurring disease within it's own context, particularly regarding the purchasing power of fiat currency. As a tax paying citizen, you have a choice not just to accept the decaying fiat system in your country, but to take a stand against it. Think about it, what if every citizen decide not to use their local currency? That would certainly get the attention of politicians and government officials. If they saw that people were opting for alternatives, maybe they'd take inflation more seriously. Better yet, they might even consider dumping their local currency in favor of a more stable medium of exchange.

Imagine a world where more people chose to save their money in a currency that retains its value, like Bitcoin. This isn't just a financial decision, it's an act of civil disobedience. By opting for Bitcoin, you’re not just preserving your wealth, you’re rejecting the narrative that you have to comply with a failing system. If enough people did this, it could force a serious conversation about the efficacy of fiat currencies and the need for alternatives.

El Salvador's decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender is a bold example. They've shown that it's possible to challenge traditional financial systems and seek greater sovereignty over economic choices. As they reduce their reliance on the IMF and other financial institutions, they are paving the way for a new economic paradigm. If they can navigate this uncharted territory and come out stronger, it could inspire a wave of similar initiatives across the globe.

So, as we navigate these complex economic waters, let’s not forget that the root cause of our struggles with inflation often boils down to our ignorance of the choices available to us. By educating ourselves and choosing alternatives like Bitcoin, we can reclaim our financial sovereignty. It’s time to take our hard earned money seriously and consider what it means to have purchasing power in a world where traditional currencies are losing their value.

Let’s not wait for politicians or officials to make the first move. The power is in our hands. Why not start a conversation about financial independence today?
